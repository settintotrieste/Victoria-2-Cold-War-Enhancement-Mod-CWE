sign_abm_treaty_title;Ratify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
sign_abm_treaty_desc;The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) was an arms control treaty originally proposed between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons. This treaty will prevent $COUNTRY$ from obtaining an ABM system.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_abm_title;Establish an Anti-Ballistic Missile system;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_abm_desc;An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term "anti-ballistic missile" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat, however it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). This will allow us to eventually develop a system to mitigate the severity of a nuclear attack on our nation.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_abm_title;Terminate our Anti-Ballistic Missile system;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_abm_desc;By terminating our Anti-Ballistic Missile system, we can save a huge amount of money that is used to maintain this system for our other national needs. Furthermore, the relinquishing of ABMs will also help to convince the world of our peaceful intentions.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_abm_treaty_title;Withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
remove_abm_treaty_desc;This is the first step in obtaining a working Anti-Ballistic Missile system that can mitigate the severity of a nuclear attack on our nation. This path will naturally entail a great deal of expense to fund the construction and vitriolic international condemnation for breaking with the established philosophy of Mutually Assured Destruction.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abmhigh_desc;This system will provide the maximum level of mitigation when it comes to a nuclear attack but comes with a high cost to maintain it.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
