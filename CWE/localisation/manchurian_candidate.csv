manchurian_programme1_desc;A sleeper agent is a spy who is placed in a target country or organisation not to undertake an immediate mission but to act as a potential asset if activated. Even if unactivated, the "sleeper agent" is still an asset and is still playing an active role in sedition, treason or espionage by virtue of agreeing to act if activated.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
manchurian_programme2_desc;An agent of influence is an agent of some stature who uses his or her position to influence public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the agent. Agents of influence are often the most difficult agents to detect, as there is seldom material evidence that connects them with a foreign power, but they can be among the most effective means of influencing foreign opinion and actions as they hold considerable credibility among the target audience.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
