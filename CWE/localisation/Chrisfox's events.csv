EVTDESC8012026;With the success of Che's revolutionaries in toppling the Bolivian government and the already chaotic situation in Peru, the charismatic figure has decided to try his luck in yet another South American nation. While he faces many of the same challenges as he did in Bolivia, the now stronger, more well funded, and hardened fighters are sure to cause trouble in their quest to paint the Americas red.
Guevera would find common ideological ground amongst Peruvians inspired by the success of the Cuban Revolution, such as radical elements within the APRA and Communist Parties, dissatisfied Quechua and Aimara peasantry still under conditions of serfdom as was the rule in Peru before the Reforma Agraria, as well as already existing Marxist-inspired guerilla movements like the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) and the Ejercito de Liberación Nacional (ELN). It remains to be seen if he would indeed connect at a personal level with the populace and be an effective operation leader, or if he would fail to so do as it happened during his foray at the Congo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012027;With Fujimori's reign now at an end, Peru is once again able to choose its own leaders. In the immediate aftermath of the end of the dictatorship elections have been called and already two parties have emerged to the forefront. The first one is the Progressive party 'Possible Peru' led by Alejandro Toledo, an economist born in an impoverished Quechua family. Adopted by Americans when he was an infant, he got to earn his undergraduate and postgraduate in the US, and promises to undo centuries of neglect to the poorest strata of Peru, having been poor himself. The second option is the traditional left-wing party in the nation, APRA, led by former president Alan Garcia, who returned from his self imposed exile in Paris, vowing to have learned from his previous failures during this rule. He seeks to reinstate APRA in government once again, and prove to Peru that he is worthy of being a stateman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012028;2006 marked the first serious attempt at the Ethnocacerists to achieve power through democratic means. Having joined the UPP earlier explicitly to run in the elections Ollanta faces stern opposition from the now much more reestablished traditional party on the left - the APRA. 
Constant associations with his brother Antauro, who had led an attempted uprising just a year before, overt diplomatic and financial backing from Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, and accusations of authoritarian rhetoric plagued Ollanta's campaign - almost assuring a loss in the run-offs. Meanwhile, Alan Garcia, having presented himself as a more mature politician, yet still attuned to the less fortunate classes of Peruvian society that form the backbone of the APRA militancy, leads the polls, assuring that during his rule, Peru would not only develop its economy and standard of living, but also stay away from Chavist influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012029;Peruvians return to the polls once again, this time with more contention on the ballot than ever before since the end of the dictatorship. Currently there are two candidates leading the polls. The first one is the 'Peruvian Nationalist Party' candidate Ollanta Humala, having reinvented himself into a more moderate position, far from Ethnocaceristic or Marxist ideals, yet still defending a leftist platform. The second alternative is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of the former dictator Alberto Fujimori, running for the first time for president having served a term as congresswoman, representing a new iteration of the party built by her father during the 90s. This election pits two fears against one another, the fear of a return to the Fujimorism of the 90s, or an uncertain future with an apparently reinvented Ollanta who has previously expressed adherence to the radical 'Ethnocacerist' ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012030;In 2009 a decision by the government to allow oil companies to exploit resources in the Amazon sparked a campaign of civil disobedience and advocacy amongst the local Indigenous people that would last for more than a year.  It resulted in the government declaring martial law in the region, as well as curtailing civil liberties to attempt to quell unrest - part of a larger political crisis in Peru spurred on by a free trade agreement with the US. As the situation worsened, the military was eventually called into the Bagua province where a main bulk of the protests were occurring in what became known as the 'Baguazo'. What would follow were two days of violence between government forces and the protesters, resulting in dozens of lives lost and many more wounded. The incident would go on to destabilize the already shaky government further - leading to resignations and a repeal of the laws that led to the protests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012031;The ICC has finally released its judgement on the long-standing dispute over the maritime borders of Peru and Chile. What has been a point of contention between the two countries since after their independence was deferred to the international community for an official solution back in 2008 in - Peru's hope - securing the nation a win against its long-time rival. The decision, however, has dashed said hopes as a solution neither country had argued in favor of was brought to the table. Rather than recognizing the boundaries set by Chile or forcing a secession of the areas claimed by Peru a new boundary has been set attempting to accommodate both claims by drawing the new boundaries between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012033;Desiring a stronger and more united Peru, the ability to stand up more firmly to American imperialism, and wishing to keep to some principles of his self-ascribed ethnocacerist ideology - Humala has today announced the start of talks with Bolivia in hopes of deepening cooperation between the two nations. Mainly focusing on resistance to neo-colonialism and imperialism, the talks also touch on the possibility of reviving a confederation between the two nations. While Morales and Humala share a fairly good relationship, it is highly unlikely that such a massive shift in South America will come from these talks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012034;Peru's new president has come to us today in attempts to start talks on the revival of a union between our two states. Humala, who styles his ideology similar to that of MAS, claims that united our two nations can better protect their people from foreign imperialism and make a stronger impact on the region. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012035;Bolivia today has made history by accepting the proposal for our two states to become one once again! A long road lies ahead, but our two peoples shall walk it united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012100;In the midst of Peru's 'Internal Wars' a strange new line of thought seems to be emerging among both soldiers and civilians alike. While in its infancy, these ideals seem to put themselves in opposition to the line and doctrine that the government has taken towards the Indigenous and disputed lands - blending Indigenous thought together with left-wing economics and right-wing nationalism. While the founders of this new line of thought are not outwardly visible, yet, the enlisted men are already thinking outside the box, and gathering alongside their fellow troops after being discharged from active duty, in groupings of "reservistas" (men in Peruvian Armed Forces Reserve). It remains to be seen whether this new ideology is a threat - however it seems a new front to the war with the Shining Path could soon emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012101;Ethnocacerism, otherwise known as the 'Peruvian Nationalist Movement' is an ideology that coalesced out of and in response to the 'Internal Wars' in Peru. In particular as a reaction to the military doctrine that treated many Indigenous communities as foreign territories. It is the brainchild of Isaac Humala, a Quechua-speaking lawyer and former Marxist that was in his youth a Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) and Peruvian Communist Party militant. Claiming to be neither on the right or left, the movement embraces a third positionist stance that heavily ties itself to nationalism and a unique form of 'Indigenismo'. While the exact aims, policies, and positions of the group differ wildly, the common theme is the supremacy of the Indigenous groups in the country, as 'Heirs of the Inca', which includes a component of racial supremacy of the "raza cobriza" (the copper-coloured race, signifying the Peruvians of Amerindian descent) over other races, and the need to establish a regime that is led by and represents the interests of this community while resisting foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012102;The 'Levantamiento de Locumba' was an attempt by the brothers Ollanta and Antauro Humala to force the resignation of the Fujimori regime in the dying day's of the dictator's regime. The brothers and their "reservista" followers, donning weapons and uniforms, would go across Peru denouncing the government and spreading their message until their eventual arrest. While the uprising would be unsuccessful as such, as it was disolved without any shots fired, and it failed to gain widespread support throughout the country, those arrested would eventually be freed and Fujimori himself would resign only a mere three weeks later. This event also brought the Humala family more into the light of Peruvian society, and the 'Ethnocacerist Movement' they espoused. The word "Reservista" from this point on would become heavily linked to Ethnocacerism, to the point that the official parlance of the Armed Forces for refering to the personnel in reserve would change from "reservista" to "licenciado".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012103;In January of 2005, hoping to take advantage of the low approval of President Alejandro Toledo, stricken by several scandals that went from corruption accusations to failing to recognize his illegitimate daughter, and in protest to his perceived 'selling out' of the nation to nations like the US and Chile, Antauro Humala and several of his followers occupied a police station in Andahuaylas and began a small-scale uprising against the government.  Previously part of the 'Locumbazo Uprising', the revolutionary nationalist figure would see less success on his second attempt at ousting the government as his coup began to quickly fall apart. While having more followers than during Locumbazo, and being more heavily armed, his forces were eventually forced into surrender by the government after a detachment of Special Forces were sent to surround the city. Antauro Humala would be arrested, denied by his brother Ollanta as he would run for president in the following year, and Ethnocacerism would be regarded as a violent organization... But it would not be the end of Ethnocacerism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012104;Antauro Humala, one of the leaders of the Ethnocacerist Movement within Peru, has recently published a series of books outlining his views and aims for the movement. Delving from geopolitical arguments supporting his vision, and making forays into reinterpreting and bringing back the extinct Incan cults into the mainstream, as a way to stand against the ideals brought over by the "invaders", Humala's writings didn't cease to be distributed even after his incarceration after the Andahuaylazo. Written in plain Spanish, so that more people from the lower classes could read and understand them, these texts help to clarify its points and frames the ideology in context of other Indigenous movements across the Americas, setting it to other streams of thought as well as outlining and refining its goals and aims. Perhaps the most known of these works would be "From Ethnosacred war to the Tahuantinsuyan Church", which would be featured in the International Book Fair of Lima, gaining international notoriety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012105;Peru is now in a state of chaos. The government has fallen, parties are scrambling to organize for elections, and at the forefront of the nation stand the now triumphant Humala brothers with their "reservistas" who were responsible toppling the deeply unpopular, yet democratic, regime. While initially only an attempt at bringing down the president and his ministers, some Peruvian Army officers that were former classmates of the Humala brothers, and now are in positions of power as generals and colonels, have began to suggest that the time has come for a new path for Peru - one guided by its Indigenous people in the footsteps of their ancestors. If the Humala family is willing to conduct the process, and develop even further the Ethnocacerist Movement, while allowing them to continue their military career, they are willing to put their men and equipment to the service of the Movement. While this would indeed signal the end of democracy in Peru, it would be the beginning of the vindication of the "raza cobriza" in Peru and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012106;With a new regime now in place the question of leadership has arisen. The obvious choices would be either Ollanta or Antauro - both of which participated in the original uprisings to oust Fujimori and Toledo and are fiery characters with experience in the military and politics. 
However there are two other choices to consider that have some support within the new Nationalist Party, one being the original ideological founder of the movement, the former communist Isaac Humala, the "Patriarch" of the family, which still holds Marxist ideals close to heart. The other being the relatively unknown Ulises Humala, an economics engineer and university professor who studied his postgraduate in France, who styles himself a more moderate nationalist and a 'pragmatist', although not shy to use force if prompted, similar to his brothers and father. Whatever the choice, given the nebulous nature of the Ethnocacerist Movement, it is likely that the initial leader of the state will dictate the standard for the ideology going forward, even if the rest of the family will not necessarily agree with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012107;Despite having guided our revolution since its birth with a fiery zeal, Isaac's age has finally started to catch up to him. Recently our leader has announced his retirement from politics, having already tapped one of his three children as potential successors - with each already campaigning within the upper ranks of the party for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8012108;With Ollanta taking over as President the time has come to decide on the fate of possible reforms. Ollanta himself wishes to see a modernization of the regime, with an opening of the command-style economy and a more pragmatic approach to foreign and domestic affairs. However, many within the party are unlikely to be pleased with radical change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012109;With Ulises now occupying the post of President the time has come to decide the fate of possible reforms. Considering himself a 'moderate' and 'pragmatist', Ulises wishes to do away with the more overt authoritarianism of the 'Incan' state and open the country up both within and without. While such sweeping reforms are likely to upset the hardliners within the party, Ulises hinges on support from the population for much of his planned agenda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012110;With his reforms resulting in backlash not only from within the party, but from the populace as well, Ollanta is faced with almost no other choice but to resign. Already Antauro has come out against the 'neoliberal reforms', promising a return to the policies of his father - pitting himself in opposition not only to Ollanta but to Ulises as well, who promises a more 'honest reform' of the nation and a turn towards more pragmatic and democratically-based policies. Though there are a small number within the party and military that continue to support Ollanta silently, though a move to stay in power with their support would likely cause even more unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012111;The DPRK has an interesting ideology - it incorporates elements of strong nationalism with a socialist system. While far from Marxism-Leninism, the 'Third Positionism' of our Ethnocacerist Movement could blend in elements of this system with our own for a stronger and more stable ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8023012100;With Stalin's death and new policies within the USSR a wave of so-called 'De-Stalinization' has swept across the Eastern Bloc nations. While Romania has been steadfastly pro-Stalinist since the proclamation of the proletarian dictatorship, the question now faces the leadership on how viable it is to keep to policies that have seemed to quickly fall out of favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012101;While many both within and beyond the borders of the Soviet Union oppose the new policies of 'De-Stalinization', none could be considered as strong of a holdout within the Soviet sphere as Romania. While the loyalty and hardline adherence to Stalinism served the late Soviet leader well, it poses a problem for the new - more moderate - leadership.\n\nGiven that Gheorghiu-Dej seems to have no intention of following the course outlined by the Soviet example, and the examples being followed in several Eastern Bloc states, some have - though in no serious capacity - suggested that the USSR take a more active approach in ensuring the new line is followed. However, others have argued that given Romania's stability any massive shift in their politics, especially one instigated by Moscow, could have dire consequences down the line. In either case, the official position has yet to be set.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012102;With our refusal to betray Stalin's legacy the USSR's new revisionist leadership has given us an ultimatum, bow before the new line being towed or have it forced upon us. While many within the party are confident of Romania's ability to rally popular support against any coup attempt by the Soviets, others have expressed concern that a refusal to follow Moscow's line could result in another lengthy occupation of the country and an unfavorable renegotiation of post-war treaties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012103;The Soviet Union, victorious, has dictated terms for the establishment of a new transitional government to oversee the reestablishment of its authority. Many members of the 'Prison Faction' that stood resolute in defense of Stalinism and in defiance of so-called 'revisionism' have already been arrested or ousted from government and members of the 'Moscow Faction' have already been tapped for replacing the now vacant positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012104;With Gheorghiu-Dej's grip on Romania having weakened with the death of Stalin and pressure from a now anti-Stalinist Moscow, forces within the political apparatuses of the nation and party have moved quickly to replace the old defender of the Stalinist order. Pauker, already having been in a position of power and prominence, has rallied her support within the 'Moscow Faction' and courted enough moderate support to ensure Gheorghiu-Dej's ouster without issue - as well as to secure her own place within Romanian politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012105;Gheorghiu-Dej's death means the passing of the torch of Romanian politics to another within the party.  Apostol's remaining support within the party and prominence within Romania mean a more competitive succession. Already both of the prospective candidates are attempting to rally enough support to be nominated as the next First Secretary. While Ceaucescu seems to have a slight advantage due to infighting, Apostol remains a solid choice for many who hope to continue the competent stability of the previous decade with a more tested hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012106;Even before her rise to now, Ana Pauker had helped facilitate the emigration of several thousand Romanian Jews to the new state of Israel - defying the Stalinist norm at the time that saw increasing restrictions on both emigration and immigration. While many Jews remained in Romania, her efforts had earned her ire from political rivals and praise from her political allies and the Jewish community itself.\n\nHowever, now that she is no longer challenged by those same Stalinist forces the opportunity has arisen to provide a 'Right of Return' to all of Romania's remaining Jews to their new homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012107;With power in Romania now passing to anti-Stalinists, the time has come to purge the late Soviet leader's influence from within the party and Romanian society. Ana Pauker - initially seen as supportive of the direction of the new government before turning out of its favor with increasingly vocal opposition - has today announced a campaign of liberalization within the party, with even more far-reaching plans for strengthening the 'Moscow Faction' influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012108;The 'Magyar Wing' of Romania's Communist Party was dissolved in 1953, just a year after the creation of the 'Magyar Autonomous Region' in Romania. It had provided one of the few mechanisms for Hungarians in Romania to fight against the increasing policy of 'Romanianization' from the Nationalists and Stalinists that had helped prop up the rule of Gheorghiu-Dej. \n\nGiven that the Stalinists no longer wield much political influence - the question has been brought up by more liberal-minded party members as to a potential revival of this institution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012109;Ana Pauker, during the rule of previous First Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej, had been a vocal opponent of the forced collectivization and the hardline and strict persecution of the bourgeoisie. She had been able to exert the influence she held to moderate such policies, however with her now occupying the position of her former rival the opportunity has arisen to completely reassess those policies in their entirety. Already she has outlined plans to move towards more voluntary collectivization, enact limited market reforms, incorporate more organizations into the People's Democratic Front, and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012110;Ana Pauker, First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, has passed away today due to complications from cancer. Already, however, her supporters have moved to secure her legacy within Romania. Teohari Georgescu has risen as the favourite from the 'Moscow Faction' camp, facing opposition from Apostol who has taken on a more vocally Stalinist and hardline tone - decrying Romania's current state as 'revisionist'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012111;Citing a rapidly deteriorating health, First Secretary Teohari Georgescu has today announced his retirement from his post - and politics. While he has thus served as a competent moderate from the 'Moscow Faction' of the party - his succession is not so clear cut. The two most notable candidates are the even more reform-oriented Ion Illescu and the Stalinist-Reformist Apostol. Both enjoy support within the party and in Moscow itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012112;Ceaucescu's disastrous decisions to embark on increased trade with the west, as well as his liberal usage of money loaned to Romania for development on projects that never saw completion, have drained the countries coffers and cost the regime a great deal of support both within and outside of the party. With new leadership, it is finally time to rectify the situation and begin the process of repaying Romania's debts, reinvesting in the unfinished projects, fostering trade ties with more friendly regimes, and increasing spending on social programs for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012113;De-Stalinization in Romania brought about a period of openness and liberalization that saw the implementation of various reforms both political and economic. Under such a system Apostol himself was able to rise, in part thanks to the gradual removal of more hardline opponents from positions of power. However, the first Secretary position is now held by a Stalinist once more - if only a moderate one. The question has turned to the fate of the ideology has a whole within Romania, with many pointing out the stability the system brought while others contrast with the strict repressions and conservatism that run counter to more open variants of socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012114;Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej, while having its own set of troubles, saw an increase in living standards and an overall recovery and growth in the post-war Romania economy. However, those times have long since past and once again the need arises to help steer Romania towards the path of prosperity. With Apostol and his allies holding the reigns of power, any reform and shift in economic policy is expected to be more in line with the previous course - only making changes and adapting where need be to fit the current material conditions of the country and wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012115;Ceaucescu's attempt at opposing the might of the Soviet Union has come to an end in contrast to the former First Secretary's wishes. With Moscow's authority now restored, now instead has been vested into the hands of the loyal Stalinist Apostol in hopes that his leadership of Romania will steer the nation to be more in line with the Eastern Bloc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012116;After nearly a decade of economic downturn, constant delays in various uncompleted projects, and increasing orientation towards Western trading partners - Romania finally sees the fruit of its hardships. With many projects now nearing their completion and beginning to increase production and pay their dues, Ceaucescu has made the decision to gradually cancel austerity measures - investing the new revenue back into Romania. Hopefully this will be the start of a period of economic growth and recovery, and win back the initial popularity the statesman held when he first assumed his office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012117;During the tumultuous events that swept across the Eastern Bloc, Hungary was seemingly one of the multiple regimes to fall. While this leaves us even more vulnerable to encroachment and imperialism from the West, we are not left without recourse.\n\nMany within the party are suggesting that we set aside funding to provide to the communist forces in Hungary to quickly reorganize themselves and participate in the next elections. While it's unlikely they will be able to do much within the confines of a bourgeoise state, maintaining some degree of relations with our former Bloc members will go a long way to securing the continuation of our Socialist Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012118;Ceaucescu's disastrous decisions to embark on increased trade with the west, as well as his liberal usage of money loaned to Romania for development on projects that never saw completion, have drained the countries coffers and cost the regime a great deal of support both within and outside of the party. With new leadership, it is finally time to rectify the situation and begin the process of repaying Romania's debts, reinvesting in the unfinished projects, fostering trade ties with more friendly regimes, and increasing spending on social programs for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012119;Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej, while having its own set of troubles, saw an increase in living standards and an overall recovery and growth in the post-war Romania economy. However, those times have long since past and once again the need arises to help steer Romania towards the path of prosperity. With Ion Illescu holding the position of First Secretary its almost certain that the response to the changing material conditions in Romania and the wider world will be more sweeping and wide-spread than under the previous leaders of the party - with programs already laid out to implement market reforms within the nation modeled after the Reformists in the CPSU and the CPC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012120;Facing mounting unrest and wide-spread protests as the communist Eastern Bloc faces a crisis of unprecedented scale - the government of Ion Illescu today has announced its intention to meet with prominent figures within the anti-government movement in hopes of working towards a peaceful solution to the unrest within the nation. While Illescu is seen as a reformist candidate and many expect him to make numerous concessions, confidence remains high that communism will be preserved within Romania and that any reforms will take place within the existing framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023008;The years 1945 and 1946 in Romania were marked not only by the end of a calamitous war, but by one of the worst droughts in Romanian history. While the nation itself was no stranger to these phenomena, this one is proving to be more than a disaster. The damage to crops and agriculture yields would go on to result in famine across the post-war landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023009;Even prior to the Second World War, Romania's economy had struggled. With the war itself, Romania was left in ruins. The Romanian leu, having been heavily tied to the German Reichsmark thanks to the influence exerted on the nation by the nazi regime, now suffered from severe inflation and poor exchange rates. Additionally, droughts and fighting had taken their toll on both industry and agriculture, leaving little in the post-war state. With the conclusion of the war, and the new state in which Romania finds itself, it is almost certain much effort is required to pull the country from the brink of turmoil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023010;SovRoms refers to Soviet-Romanian enterprises created throughout Romania in the years following the creation of the Socialist Republic of Romania. In theory their design was to facilitate economic rebuilding and restructuring within the new state. In practice, however, they would pivot Romania's exports towards the USSR and serve as an addition means of enforcing post-war reparations - a process that would continue until the death of Stalin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023011;After nearly two years of one of the worst droughts in Romania's history the country's luck has seemingly finally taken a turn for the better. Ample rainfall has lead to a boost in agricultural production, as well as a reduction of the severity of the famines that had struck during those two prior years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230121;Romania's currency - the 'Romanian leu' - is still struggling from the effects of the second world war. Economic devastation, increasing inflation, and absurd exchange rates stifle any sense of recovery. In this environment it has been decided to enact a series of reforms aimed at providing a remedy for this and facilitating Romania's post-war recovery.\n\n Under these plans - referred to as the 'Great Stabilization' - the 'First leu' would be succeeded by by the 'Second leu', with the old currency being replaced via a set exchange rate. These changes, while drastic, are seen as the only way out of the dire situation the country finds itself in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230122;Two major factions have been battling for power within the Romanian Communist Party since the nation's liberation from nazi Germany at the hands of the Soviet Union, the 'Prison Faction', informally lead by the country's current leader Gheorghiu-Dej, and the 'Moscow Faction' (sometimes called the 'Pauker Faction') lead by Ana Pauker.\n\nWhile currently Gheorghiu-Dej's pro-Stalinist and hardline 'Prison Faction' holds a dominant position, it has become increasingly threatened by the more moderate and reformist policies and positions of those in its rival group. Ana Pauker - while serving as one of the main figures in the communization of the country - has since taken a hard stance against Stalinism, halting forced collectivization, granting amnesty to former members and supporters of the former fascist regime, preserving aspects bourgeoise, and pushing to broaden the 'People's Democratic Front' coalition set up by the Communist Party. \n\nThese actions, combined with her Jewish ancestry, have earned her a less favorable outlook from Stalin in recent years. Combined with Gheorghiu-Dej's fears of a potential threat to his rule, a decision has been reached on the possibility of purging Pauker and her more vocal supporters with Soviet backing - preventing any future conflict or opposition to leadership within the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230123;Even after the previous currency reform in 1947, additional steps were taken to once again revalue the Romanian leu as well as to enact additional reforms. The reforms would also include provisions for the rate of exchange, the materials the coins were made out of, and different denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230124;Following Romania's proclamation of a Proletarian state, the country reorganized its administrative boundaries along-side the implementation of the new socialist system. While previously it had been divided into 'judetes', pressure from the USSR would see it instead organize into 'regions' and 'raions' that would serve as the base division for the new country.\n\nOne such region was set to be the 'Magyar Autonomous Region', modeled at least in aesthetic after the ASSRs found in the Soviet Union. The territory encompassed most of the historic region of 'Szekelyland' at the heart of Romania, covering territories where Hungarian was the dominant ethnic group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230125;The 'New Course', or 'Neuer Kurs' in German, referred to a series of economic and political reforms that were dictated by the USSR in the wake of Stalin's death across the Eastern Bloc countries. In Romania this would take the form of increased independence for the nation and for the ruling communist party. The SovRoms, set up as joint Soviet-Romanian enterprises in the aftermath of WWII to help reconstruct Romania's devastated economy, were fully handed over to Romania - with many being outright replaced with fully Romanian successors. \n\nOverall the 'New Course' was to, in the opinion of the USSR and the supporters of the program, 'correct the errors of the past' as well as to lead to a more prosperous post-war situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230126;With Stalin's death and new policies within the USSR a wave of so-called 'De-Stalinization' has swept across the Eastern Bloc nations. While Romania has been steadfastly pro-Stalinist since the proclamation of the proletarian dictatorship, the question now faces the leadership on how viable it is to keep to policies that have seemed to quickly fall out of favor. \n\nWith the purge of the 'Moscow Faction' earlier, 'De-Stalinization' would almost certainly mean a rehabilitation of these politicians and their return to power within the communist party. Given Khrushchev's view on Stalin's legacy, many hardliners fear of Soviet influence being used to put the newly rehabilitated moderates into power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230127;The uprising in Hungary sent shockwaves through the Eastern Bloc, with the Soviet response drawing both fears and praise. In Romania, however, another fear emerged from the leadership of the nation. Already holding a nationalist lean to it, the uprising would spark concerns about the large Hungarian population within Romania. The Stalinist 'Prison Faction' and Gheorghiu-Dej would use these concerns as an excuse for furthering the aims of Romanianization, limiting the autonomy of Hungarians within Romania and taking an active role in helping to deal with the aftermath of the attempted 'revolution' in its close neighbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230128;Seeking to curb Soviet influence in Romania, and the country's increasing dependence on the USSR for exports and trade, Gheorghiu-Dej has made the suggestion that Romania - at least in a very limited degree - seek out Western partners for trade and commerce. While on the face such a plan seems absurd for a member of the Eastern Bloc, Romania's unique position presents it and opportunity few of its allies have.\n\nHowever, some within the party have even still expressed their discontent. Relying on the West - avowedly anti-communist - for trade could end up hurting Romania in the long-run. Instead, some have made the suggestion that we merely increase trade ties with our fellow Eastern Bloc members and those of CMEA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230129;The I.P.R.S. (Intreprinderea de piese radio si semiconductori), or by its English name Baneasa Radio and Semiconductor Parts Company was the name of an electronics manufacturer built in Romania during 1960 that would go on to produce electronic components - particularly semi-conductors - throughout the 70s and 80s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230130;For years now a rivalry has brewed within the inner circle of Gheorghiu-Dej between his 'protégé' Nicolae Ceaucescu and the Stalinist 'Reformist' Gheorghe Apostol. While the former has the immediate backing of the party, the latter still carries substantial influence and holds a position of authority within the party - having even briefly served as First Secretary and President of the Assembly.\n\nSeeking to tip the balance of the eventual struggle for support between the two within the party's leadership, Ceaucescu ally Ion Gheorghe Maurer has started a campaign to rally support for the young protégé - hoping to win enough to prevent Apostol from posing any significant challenge in the event of Cheorghiu-Dej's death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230131;Hoping to increase birthrates within Romania, preserve the traditional family structures within, and help increase its competitiveness with other nations - Ceaucescu today has pushed forward a new law to the National Assembly referred to as 'Decree 770'. The law, if left unchallenged, would have far-reaching effects on both healthcare and education.\n\nAiming for a population increase of nearly 10 million, the law would effectively outlaw abortion in one of the most liberal countries in Europe in regard's to reproductive rights. Not only that, but sex education and other such forms of outreach would heavily shift their focus to the virtues of motherhood and large families to help further the boom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230132;Even before the death of Gheorghiu-Dej, Soviet influence in Romania was on the decline - with the country taking an increasing independent direction both politically and economically in the face of being one of the last bastions of Stalinism in the Eastern Bloc. However, many vestiges still remain tightly gripped around Romania society. One such being the administrative system of Romania - in which the previous system was abandoned in favor of one influenced by the Soviet model. \n\nAs part of a new policy following Gheorghiu-Dej's death, dubbed 'De-Russification', such systems are slowly being abandoned. Many within the party that wish to see a continued decline of Soviet influence are instead proposing the reorganization of Romania under a new system, one that would importantly see the dissolution of the 'Magyar Autonomous Region' and a strengthening of Romania's central government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230133;Ceaucescu inherited a unique position within the Eastern Bloc - one established by his mentor and predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej. Romania, in contrast to much of the rest of the communist world at the time, enjoyed at least mildly warm relations with several western nations and even international and national organizations seen as being agents or controlled by the west. The main question facing the new administration however is whether to keep this course or start anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230134;The Research Center for the Design of Electronic Components, later renamed to the Research Institute for Electronic Components, is the name of a electronics research center built near the previously manufactured electronics factory. It would go on to conduct experiments in the field of computing within Romania - facilitating the production of gradually more advanced components.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230135;Microelectronica was created in 1981 and began production of integrated circuits the same year. Together with the I.P.R.S. it would go on to complete and complement the chain of production having already been established with the previous facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230136;The 'July Theses' referred to a speech given by Ceaucescu in which he outlined a plan to launch a 'Small Cultural Revolution' in Romania in hopes of achieving a more socialist culture as well as to some degree to emulate that which had happened in the PRC. The plan blended elements of Neo-Stalinism together with Maoism to hope to achieve some new synthesis as well as to provide a avenue for Ceaucescu to personally increase his power over the party and his popularity with the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230137;Systematization, in Romania, referred to a particular program of urban planning advocated for by the Ceaucescu administration following the leader's visit to the communist countries of East Asia. In particular he would find the particular inspiration the DPRK with the ideology of Juche and the architecture and economic direction that the country had taken since its independence. As part of the program older buildings - particularly those in smaller villages, towns, and hamlets - would be rebuilt in hopes of turning them into larger urban centers. Additionally, a massive campaign of urbanization would be undertaken to help populate these new cities - hoping to eliminate small rural population centers entirely in the stead of more developed and centralized ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230138;During the first years of his time in office, Ceaucescu enjoyed popularity brought upon by a good economy, a slight relaxing of policies, and an orientation towards a more independent course for Romania. However, since that time the tides have shifted against his favor. Various projects remain uncompleted, debt to Western powers has increased to levels that put Romania itself at risk, and several policies have bore unintended consequences that only exacerbate the rapidly deteriorating issues. In response, the IMF has laid out guidelines for Romania to follow should it seek to pay its debt, namely putting spending, reducing imports, and increasing exports. While some scoff at the idea of bowing to the IMF - the country's previous relationship with the West means that defying such an institution could have dire consequences for Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230139;With the continued lowering popularity and slow decline of the Ceau?escu regime, dissenting members of the Communist Party (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Bârl?deanu, Grigore R?ceanu, Corneliu M?nescu, and Constantin Pîrvulescu) created an 'open letter' to the regime that came to be referred to as 'The Letter of the Six'. \n\nThe letter provided a left-wing critique of the regime, as well as demands for reform by the government. While notable among the signatories was a staunch Stalinist - the letter made a point to allude to the policies and positions advocated by the 'reformists' with the CPSU and appealed to a more 'humanist' approach to socialism. It also warned of a possible future of an underdeveloped Romania under the continued mismanagement of Ceausescu and his allies.\n\nDue to Ceausescu's repression against opponents both within and without the party and the countries history of hardline Stalinism - the letter was broadcast via Western outlets such as RFE-RL, BBC, and Voice of America. The immediate aftermath saw the signatories - most of which were already in or had recently returned to Romania - arrested or otherwise removed from their positions of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230140;Amid the chaotic aftermath of the Romanian Revolution a series of violent and bloody clashes took place in Hungarian-dominated areas of the country. The extent of the altercations would leave 5 dead and 300 injured and serve to strengthen animosity between the two groups. While the events were widely publicized - even receiving media coverage at the time - the cause would be a point of contention and dispute in the years after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230141;Following the FSN stating its intention to reform into a political party and run in Romania's first elections as a western democracy, unrest broke out both from within the organization and without. Forces within the FSN that had opposed the previous communist regime and hoped to see a clean slate for Romanian politics left while protests broke out at the University of Bucharest. These protests, dominated primarily by professors and students, demanded that former communist officials be barred from running for elections and that the current government cede further towards the cause of reform. The government would go on to brand these protests as 'hooligans' (Golani in Romanian), spawning their self-given satirical name 'Golaniad'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230142;The 'Mineriads' refer to a series of wide-spread and violent protests that occurred throughout the post-communist period in Romania in 1990 and 1991. They were mostly directed at the ruling FSN, made up of both opposition parties and anti-communist elements that saw the FSN as merely a successor of the previous government rather than a complete transformation from it. The most violent of these altercations, happening in 1990, would be put down with the help of miners and workers - members of unions - called in by the government to help keep order. Over the course of each of the clashes multiple people would be killed or injured - and the continued unrest would serve to weaken the FSN's authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230143;Following the collapse of the Ceaucescu government, free elections were scheduled within Romania. While marred by violence, accusations of fraud and rigging, and continued chaos across the country - they would go on to be hailed as the nation's first free elections as a non-communist regime. Due to the haste with which they were scheduled, only two political entities were able to participate, the FSN, the dominant political force behind the Romanian Revolution, and the 'National Liberal Party'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230144;While the Romanian Revolution had established a de-jure western-styled republic, it would not be until the country's new constitution in 1991 that the 'Socialist Republic of Romania' would be officially replaced with a new entity. Facing continued pressure from the protesters, as well as finding no support from its once foreign allies, the FSN - while having within its ranks many former members of Romania's communist party - did away with the remainder of the old regime and declared a new Republic in its place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230145;In the aftermath of the chaotic and messy decommunization of Romania and the introduction of a market economy, a pyramid scheme started by Ioan Stocia managed to gain prominence. Making vague promises of massive profits to those that invested, the scheme would sweep through the nation - attracting large swaths of the population, suffering under newly imposed spending cuts, austerity, and inflation, who would go on to put most of their savings within the scheme's investments. By the time the scheme was exposed - with the company of Caritas having gone bankrupt in 1994 - nearly 35-50% of the nation had fallen prey to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230146;1992 marked the first of Romania's 'true' elections since the countries constitution in 1991 officially abolished the previous communist regime. Unlike the impromptu elections in 1990, it would not be marked by violence and chaos - instead seeing newly organized parties rise to prominence as they challenged the DFSN - a splinter of the FSN - for its place in the Romanian government. Ion Illescu, still leading the DFSN, faced off against the 'National Peasants' Party' which promised a quicker transition of the country away from its past and more extreme decommunization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230147;The 1996 elections in Romania once again pit Ion Illescu and his social democratic PDSR (the DFSN having since reorganized) against the 'National Peasants' Party', with the same dynamics at play as previous elections. Once more, the NPP would promise a faster transition to a fully market economy, as well as more strict adherence to the new governing principles while the DFSN would run on its now social democratic platform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230148;'Ostalgia', or 'Ostalgie' - made up from the German words 'Ost' and 'Nostalgie' - describes a phenomena in the post-communist states that encompasses a wide rage of favorable outlooks on the previous communist regimes in those nations. While taking different forms in different places, having different motivations, and being both manipulated by and viewed in different lights by various political groups and portions of the population - its effect on the mindset and culture of the nations and peoples that experience it is hard to ignore. Across much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc the so-called 'Ostalgia' would go on to inspire voting patterns, art, culture, and even the rise of new organizations and ideologies.\n\nIn Romania, Ostalgic views persisted far beyond the fall of the communist regime - with much of the population viewing even the Ceau?escu years, still in living memory for many, in a more positive light and many more even seeing the country as having fared better under its previous administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230149;The 2000 election in Romania would see the rise of a new prominent party to challenge the authority of the PDSR. Calling itself the 'Great Romania Party', the party would mix a blend of position and points and build them around a central theme of nationalism and conservatism. Seen by many as a 'Third Positionist' party, it rely heavily on populist rhetoric and irredentist desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230150;Romania's election in 2004 would pit both successors of the National Salvation Front against one another, the Democratic Party against once more reorganized Social Democratic Party. While both parties would run to the left at times, the Democratic Party would increasingly take on a more liberal and less social democratic policy stance over time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230151;Having faced flooding along the Danube in the year before - both Bulgaria and Romania would be stricken by a severe drought the following year in 2007. Spurred on by poor snowfall during the winter and very little rain in the Spring the event would go on to be one of most severe in Eastern Europe since after WWII - leading to millions of hectares in crops being destroyed and both nations being left with low yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230152;Romania's 2009 election would once more see the Democratic Party, now more established, face off against the Social Democrats. The election would be marked by limited controversy - claims of fraud and multiple reports of void and invalid ballots spurring on electoral challenges and interventions by neutral organizations such as the OSCE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230153;The 2014 elections in Romania saw a continuation of the scandal and controversy of the previous, adding to that even more as allegations continued to be hurled about between parties. Rising to the front to criticize the Democratic Party along-side the PSD was the 'National Liberal Party', itself making promises of ending the era of the previous administration and bring about a transformed Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230154;2019 in Romania would pit the National Liberal Party against the Social Democratic Party. While media controversy surrounded nearly all of the candidates, the fresh elections would mark a break from the previous two in terms of scandal and accusations of fraud and corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8009811;With the Second World War now at an end, and the face of Europe and Asia changed forever in its wake, the Mongolian People's Republic has decided to embark on a campaign to reach out to various countries on both continents to seek legitimacy and recognition on the international stage and solidify its independence from Moscow. Long having been viewed by the west in the same light as the USSR itself and being within the Soviet shadow, it is the hope of the ruling MPRP that the newly cemented and established communist regimes will set the stage for increased ties with more than the Soviets themselves and secure a place for Mongolia in the larger world.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009812;In 1947 Choibalsan came to the Central Committee of the MPRP claiming to be the target of a supposed assassination plot. The plot, later referred to as âPort-Arthur', while dubious in its legitimacy, was never-the-less used as a justification for the strengthening of campaigns to unite the Mongol people, empower and fund intelligence forces, crackdown on dissent and opposition, and cement the MPRP even further with drives to encourage people to join the political organization and work within the party's structures.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009813;Even prior to the Second World War, Choibalsan had held a strong nationalistic belief in the idea of a âGreater Mongolia'  even laying claim to lands held by the USSR. With Soviet support, and under his leadership, the Mongolian People's Republic had funded ethnic insurgencies in China among Mongol people and worked towards that aim. However, it wouldn't be until the conclusion of WWII and the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation that the greatest hope for a âGreater Mongolia' would present itself. \n\n In the immediate aftermath of the Soviet invasion a short-lived âPeople's Republic' would emerge in Inner Mongolia. This republic would present an opportunity that Choibalsan wasn't prepared to let go. Without Soviet approval he would send Mongol troops into the territory  ordering them to occupy the territory before Stalin forced a reversal of the policies. Only a few months later the âInner Mongolian People's Republic' would be dissolved and reintegrated into China, and with it any hope for uniting with Inner Mongolia again. \n\n Even still, it wouldn't be until the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War that tensions between Ulaanbaatar and Moscow would come to a head, with Stalin and Choibalsan having a falling out over the lack of the former's support for the latter.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009814;Some within the MPRP, hoping to strengthen ties to the USSR and even to fully follow the example of the formerly independent nation of Tannu Tuva, have made the bold suggestion that Mongolia should petition the Soviets for ascension into the union as its newest SSR. However, not everyone within the government and party are quite as enthusiastic. Already angry about Stalin's refusal to back Mongolia's claims, Choibalsan would strongly rebuke any insinuation of a union with the USSR  opposing the members of the Mongolian government that had made the proposal and furthering the already sizable rift between the Chairman and Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009815;After several months in USSR to receive treatment for cancer, Choibalsan today has passed. With his body already returned to Mongolia for burial and a state funeral and the nation approaching the end of their mourning period the question has arisen as to who will replace him. Already two notable candidates have risen to the front of politics, a loyal of Moscow and a supporter of Stalinism, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, and a loyal to the party, Dashiin Damba. While Damba would be a good choice for many, Tsedebal is further backed by his ties to the Soviet Union thanks to his unwavering support for its leadership.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009816;While the waves of de-Stalinization that had washed over Europe happened in the wake of the late Soviet leader's death, it wouldn't be until 1956  in part due to Tsedenbal himself  that the movement would finally hit Mongolia in force. Increasing calls for âParty Democracy' were joined with criticisms of Choibalsan's rule and the lingering cult of personality around the late leader  all culminating in a confrontation with the party hardliners and Tsedenbal himself, who derided the attempts at internal reform as a âthaw'. \n\n Among the biggest voices in opposition to Stalinism was Dashiin Damba, who  due to his position within the party as First Secretary  posed a significant threat to Tsedebal's grip on power. Their confrontation would come to a head only a few years after the initial calls for change, culminating in Damba's removal from the party and the further consolidation of Tsedenbal's place in Mongolian politics.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009817;The âCultural Campaigns' were a series of literacy, educational, hygienic, ideological, and social initiatives launched in Mongolia during the 50s and 60s. Their main target was the still nomadic and rural populations that had not been reached by prior campaigns to industrialize the nation and improve education and literacy among the populace. They would be met with a mostly positive reaction from these groups and serve to further cement the broader cause of modernization in Mongolia, however divides would still persist between the peripheral parts of the nation and the more urbanized and industrialized cities and towns as development carried on.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009818;In an effort both to secure influence in Mongolia and further develop its neighbor  China in 1959 began to send aid to the small country in order to facilitate its development. This assistance, however, did not merely consist of monetary payments. Instead, China would also send its own workforce over to supplement the country's smaller population and help to reach a level of production and development that would otherwise be impossible within Mongolia.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009819;The third stage of Mongolian Economic development, fully called 'Completion of the Construction of the Material and Technical Basis of Socialism', was planned to be the final step in Mongolia's path to becoming a developed industrialized nation. The period of development, starting in 1960, would be marked by a focus on both agricultural and industrial growth  aided significantly by Mongolia's admission to CEMA and aid from the organization.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009820;Within the MPRP lay many with a strong sense of nationalism and a love for Mongolia, with many that even go so far as to oppose Soviet influence in the country. However, Tsedenbal's loyalty to the USSR and its backing for him within Mongolian politics has led to a crackdown on this in recent years. Even as the shadow of Stalinism continues to loom over politics the hallmark nationalism usually associated with it has been slowly etched away by political maneuvering from the Chairman and his allies. \n\n One such member of the party targeted by this campaign, serving currently as a member of the Politburo, is Daramyn Tomor-Ochir. Previously seen as a close ally to Tsedenbal, he has slowly started to be seen as a potential rival and threat to Soviet influence in the country. With the one of the most recent open displays of Tomor-Ochir's nationalism being an endorsement of a celebration of Genghis Khan, Tsedebal is hoping that it will be enough of a justification to eliminate the now rival's influence within the party.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009821;Hoping to take advantage of Tsendenbal's absence from the country  with the leader currently occupied with medical treatment in the Soviet Union  Second Secretary of the MPRP Luvsantserengiin Tsend has convened a meeting of the Politburo to discuss a potential replacement for the increasingly Stalinist-leaning General Secretary. However, Tsendenbal's hastened return to Mongolia would prompt a confrontation in which Tsend's attempt at an ouster would be put to an end and the Second Secretary dismissed and replaced with a more loyal party member.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009822;Inspired by events in the Soviet Union, former members of the MPRP's leadership and government Tsogt-Ochiryn Lookhuuz and Baldandorjiin Nyambuu (later joined by Bandiin Surmaajav) would conspire to form their own âAnti-Party Group' aimed at the removal of Tsedenbal and a restoration of a more collective leadership principle within the Mongolian People's Republic. Initially they had hoped that speaking out against Tsedenbal at a meeting of the Central Committee would prove to be all the spark needed to coax others into joining, however an increasing isolation and ouster of critics and Soviet support for Tsedenbal would ultimately doom their plans and lead to their own ouster from the party as a result of their plot.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009823;While Tsedenbal, as a result of continued persecution of his rivals in the party and his backing from Moscow, had managed to secure himself the position of âsupreme leader' of Mongolia (holding several positions of power beyond the initial title of just Head of Government) his authority has been waning in recent years. Jambyn Batmonkh, has recently risen to the position of chair  bolstered by support within the party and a lack of opposition from Tsedenbal himself.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009824;Today Tsedenbal has been ousted from leadership at a congress of the MPRP. While once commanding a large degree of power and influence within the party a number of factors have blended together to culminate in the move - increased pressure from the populace and party, support for the ouster by Batmonkh, and a dwindling support for the leader from the USSR. Instead, the previously elected Head of Government Batmonkh will take the place previously held by Tsedenbal  working to address the issues left behind in the wake of the previous administration and continue the ongoing economic development of the country.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009825;Today marks the beginning of the Soviet withdraw from $country$ and the end of support for the regime from our larger neighbor. With the Union increasingly facing problems of its own and its leadership pivoting towards a more reformist course a plan has been outlined for the complete removal of all military forces from Mongolia and the closure of all Soviet military bases within. While some see this as a sign of Mongolia moving towards increased independence from a country that had long exerted influence upon it, many more see it as a sign of things to come  with murmurs already arising from the population.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009826;âOstalgia', or 'Ostalgie'  made up from the German words âOst' and âNostalgie'  describes a phenomena in the post-communist states that encompasses a wide rage of favorable outlooks on the previous communist regimes in those nations.

Across much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc the so-called âOstalgia' would go on to inspire voting patterns, art, culture, and even the rise of new organizations and ideologies. \n\n In Mongolia, feelings of nostalgia for the former communist regime would persist among certain portions of the population - being channeled by the now social democratic Mongolian Revolutionary People's Party into securing its continued dominance in the country's politics.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009827;After democratization two major forces emerged within Mongolian politics, the now social-democratic MPRP and the conservative and liberal coalition of the Democratic Party. While the MPRP capitalized on support for the social programs that had long been in place in the nation, the Democratic Party would contest with their own platform of continued privatization and a transition away from the country's past. \n\n Mongolia's elections in 1992 marked the country's first as a western-styled democracy, happening almost immediately after the adoption of its new constitution.

Ultimately it would culminate in declarations that the results were fraudulent, with further allegations beyond bribery being levied. These allegations would ultimately lead to violence, rioting, and unrest into the following year.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVTDESC81098100;With De-Stalinization having run its course, and the party opening up more and more to critique and pluralism, it was inevitable that Tsedendal's position would come under threat. His political rivals, free from any possible reappraisal and finding increasing support within the Khural, have decided to finally make their move in ousting the Stalinist and pro-Moscow politician. To replace him a few notable candidates have risen above the rest, notably the nationalist leaning Daramyn Tomor-Ochir and the party loyalist Dashiin Damba.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098101;Stalin's death and new policies within the USSR have resulted in a wave of so-called âDe-Stalinization' throughout the Soviet sphere of influence. This wave has now reached Mongolia, and with the death of the Stalinist Choibalsan many were already questioning the policies and practices of the late leaders and the viability of preserving their legacy moving forward. \n\n Damba, while previously a supporter of Choibalsan, has signaled his support for moves to step away from the previous legacy of Mongolia  instead pushing for more transparency within the party and more openness socially and politically.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098102;With his advancing age and waning support within the ruling MPRP, Dashiin Damba today has announced his retirement. Already two candidates  each prominent members of the party themselves  have risen to be the possible successor for the outgoing Chair. The first of these, Tumur-Ochir, represents the more nationalist lean of the party  expressing a desire to preserve Mongolian culture and increase its independence from the USSR while maintaining good relations with China. The second is Jambyn BatmÃ¶nkh who styles himself as a reformist, having previously served as a professor prior to his entry into politics.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098103;While the situation in Mongolia remains stable for the moment, troubles seem to be on the horizon. Reforms in the USSR and a withdraw of its forces from Eastern Europe have set off a series of events that are quickly leading to massive shifts in the world order. Already many governments have started rapid responses in the form of reform, thaw, or crackdowns. Hoping to pre-empt the unrest being seen elsewhere, many within the party are proposing pre-emptive and pragmatic reforms based on the experiences of both the USSR and the PRC.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098104;The Soviet dissolution brought economic, political, and social chaos to Russia. In the midst of this violent ethnic clashes occurred within the Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic  now within the Russian Federation and in the process of reorganization. These clashes present an opportunity for the nationalists within the MPRP to liberate the Tuvans from Russia, providing weapons, funding, and using our own media and institutions to provoke further unrest. While extremely risky, many are confident that Russia lacks the ability to fully respond to any actions currently, and that another chance like this is unlikely to arise as the situation slowly stabilizes.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098105;Violent clashes in Tuva have spiraled out of control, with separatist rebels storming the autonomous region's administrative centers and ousting pro-Russian authorities. Already they have drafted a declaration of secession from Russia and created interim political organizations  hoping to find international backing and recognition. While the situation in Russia is chaotic currently with the dissolution of the USSR still taking its toll on the nation's economy and institutions, allowing a province to declare itself separate could create cracks in the Russian state and show weakness to other forces that might see Russia divided even further.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098106;The chaotic situation in Russia has led to the uprising in Tannu Tuva being a success. With the failure of the Russian state to reassert control the country has once more gained its independence  with Mongolian backing. Of course, now the decision has arisen as to how to respond to this newly created state. Many within the party still retain the idea from so many decades ago of striving towards a âGreater Mongolia', though others urge caution and suggest using the existing influence Mongolia now holds instead.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098107;Since its foundation, the Mongolian People's Republic has had to balance the influence and interests of both China and the USSR  relying on good relations with one at the cost of the other while having to be wary of and weave around the interests and conflicts of both. However, not all within the MPRP have supported this foreign policy by choice. The shaky status quo has instead become a matter of pragmatism, and with the previous administrations having been unfriendly to the idea of a neutral Mongolia such a reality was left to be the only option. \n\n With the new leadership, however, one more friendly to the prospect of a stronger Mongolian presence on the world stage and a more assertive foreign policy, the question has been revived in a much more serious capacity. Even still, one large obstacle is yet to remain, a potential Soviet response to an independent Mongolia. For decades the nation has been firmly within the Soviet sphere and even played a role in the split with China  and the mixed reception to similar calls for autonomy from within the Soviet sphere give no definitive answer as to what the Soviet response could be, though many believe it might be worth a potential confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098108;Mongolia, long within the Soviet sphere, has recent taken steps to draw further from Moscow. While the leadership have assured us that such a move is no threat to the relationship between the USSR and the Mongolian People's Republic, many still perceive it as a possible threat to Soviet influence in Asia. \n\n As such, the serious consideration of an intervention to put in place a more friendly leadership has been raised. With a Soviet military presence still in Mongolia, for now, such an action would  while still drawing ire from the international community  likely not warrant too much of a push back from the likes of China or the West.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098109;With the Soviet intervention having been met with success the previous administration that sought to attempt to win Mongolian independence from its larger neighbor's influence has been ousted. Instead the old leader, a Moscow Loyal, Tsedenbal has been put into power. Already he has begun to consolidate his influence, taking steps to secure his position and reaffirm Mongolia's allegiance to the Soviets.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098110;While Tsedenbal had attempts at de-Stalinization, such actions ultimately led to his political downfall. Now, with his ouster complete, there can be an honest reevaluation of Mongolia's past and a slow dismantling of the cult of personality around the likes of Choibalsan and Stalin himself. In addition to this many party members have made proposals of more open discourse within the party, making an official break with previous lines and ensuring any future abuse of power.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098111;During the Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia took the side of the USSR. While it relied on both nations for its economic development, the historical ties to the Soviet Union and enmity with China made the option of remaining neutral non-viable. Such an action cost Mongolia the support of China. Resources, Manpower, and more were cut off and the economic development of the country was set back. \n\n With Mongolia now independent, however, there is now an opportunity to once more benefit from friendship with China. While its likely that there will not be the same level of support that was offered before, it will none-the-less help Mongolia.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098112;The tumultuous events that have rocked the socialist camp in Europe and the USSR have not spared Mongolia. Already opposition forces have monopolized on growing unrest and instability  forming new organizations and movements across the country. While up until this point the party has acted with increasing transparency and leniency to dissent  it seems even those reforms have not been enough. Hoping to preserve socialism in Mongolia however, many of the more reformist leaning party members have suggested making concessions to the opposition within the framework of socialism, preserving the Mongolian People's Republic while adapting its institutions to a changing world.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098113;Long having been a vocal voice and active proponent in securing Mongolia's place within CMEA, and from there furthering its ties to its European allies, Luvsantserengiin Tsend now hopes to increase that relationship even further with increased trade to Europe. While Mongolia have done well with its modernization and economic development, there is still much work to be done  and it is the hopes of those that support the move that by increasing Mongolia's exports and moving away by a reliance on Soviet and Chinese inputs that the country can hasten those final steps.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81098114;Chairman Luvsantserengiin Tsend today has passed, leaving Mongolia to mourn the passing of a loyal servant of the people while those in the party scramble to find a replacement. Already two notable candidates have risen above the rest to vie for the spot  Batmonkh, a former professor and reformist, as well as Tomor-Ochir who has been increasingly vocal about his nationalist views.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8017625;The 'Khost disturbances', or more widely known as the 'Afghan Tribal Revolts', were a series of revolts by the Zadran, Safi, and Mangal tribesmen in the southeastern sections of the Kingdom of Afghanistan that took place from 1944 to 1947. The most prevalent causes of the unrest was opposition to the policies of the Afghan government at the time as well as the worsening conditions - with poverty having grown in recent years. \n\n While a bulk of the fighting had taken place in the early days of the revolts, which themselves were largely unsuccessful and relegated to the border between the - at the time - British Raj and Afghanistan, they would shake the Afghan state and pave the way for future unrest in the region. Sporadic unrest and fighting would continue for years after, with the Afghan government eventually taking a more hands off approach to the areas to avoid provoking further action.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017626;Since the declaration of the 'Durand Line' by the British in 1863, the Pashtun people have been forced to accept a political reality of subjugation and division. The 'Line' set the borders between Afghanistan and what would later be part of the British Raj before decolonization - settling issues on the limits of the British spheres of influence in Central Asia. This decision, seemingly, would completely shelf the idea of a united Pashtun state indefinitely, with attempts to reunite the peoples being wholly unsuccessful and serving only to further entrench the British influence. \n\n However, with recent events in the world it seems the hope of a united 'Pashtunistan' has seemingly been born anew. The Pashtun peoples of the North-West Frontier Province have made a formal declaration - which they are calling the 'Bannu Resolution' - in which they express their desire to for independence from the British Raj entirely, rather than remaining part of either India or Pakistan. Many more within that same movement hope for unification with Afghanistan, drawing the attention of many that hold more nationalist leanings within the Kingdom who hope that with a declaration of support and what little pressure they are able to exert on the British that a simple demand could become a reality.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017627;The 'Durand Line', created in 1863 to officially settle matters of British influence in Central Asia, has long stood as the final borders between the Afghan Kingdom and British India. While contentious, having divided the Pashtun people, it has remained in place since its creation with little alteration aside from additional treaties with the bordering Afghan state - owing to a swift response to various revolts and risings against its imposition as well as agreement and cooperation from the Afghan government. \n\n However, with plans for an independent India and Pakistan slowly coming to fruition, many in the North-West Frontier Province have begun to voice a more open dissatisfaction with the options presented to them by the authorities within the Raj. Rather than having the open choice of joining either Pakistan or India, instead they have issued a resolution calling for options for complete Independence, and even a union with Afghanistan, be added to any potential referendum in the region.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017628;In a surprising turn of events, the United Kingdom has agreed to allow the Pashtun people within British India the chance at self-determination and independence. While a far cry from the full extent that the nationalists within Afghanistan want, it is set to be the first step in the road to reuniting Pashtunistan under a single state once more.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017629;Despite support from both the Pashtun community within British India and from the Afghan government, the British have declined the demands set forth in the Bannu Resolution. Instead, they have decided to go forward with holding their already planned referendum, ensuring that the territories will be part of the future state of Pakistan.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017630;The Democratic Women's Organization of Afghanistan, or DOWA, was a women's advocacy group founded in the capital city of Kabul by various prominent Afghan women. Initially somewhat independent, it quickly aligned itself with the various communist organizations in the country and took an extremely active political role - working against traditionalism and organizing action against attempts to curtail gender equality within the country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017631;The 1964 constitution, while not fully enacted by the King, brought a new era to the politics of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. While voter turnout would remain low during the first few elections, as more and more of the populace - especially in more urban and developed areas - became involved in politics the numbers would eventually swell. Even still, conservatives remained a dominant political force, in part due to lingering political restrictions, as well as corruption. \n\n The 1965 elections were themselves dominated by the more urban sectors of the population - especially in and around Kabul. This factor, combined with low voter turnout, would allow more progressive minded elements to gain power within the parliament, though even still conservatives remained a powerful force and the King's interference would remain present.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017632;While promises of democracy and increased freedom had flowed from the elites of Kabul, very little became a political reality. Voter turnout in the country remained low, interference from the Monarch remained, and political parties faced difficulties in promoting candidates. \n\n Speaking out against what they saw as a corrupt, repressive regime and goaded on by both political organizations within and outside of the government, including prominent leftist organizations, Student protests broke out following the 1965 elections - aiming to occupy the legislature and frustrate its operations until their demands were fulfilled. While initially these protests were met with a cautious muted response from the government, as they dragged on more and more of a response was demanded from police and military. The growing tension eventually escalated into a confrontation that left at least 3 dead, putting an end to the protests while only serving to fan the flames of anti-government sentiments among the population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017633;The 1964 constitution, while not fully enacted by the King, brought a new era to the politics of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. While voter turnout would remain low during the first few elections, as more and more of the populace - especially in more urban and developed areas - became involved in politics the numbers would eventually swell. Even still, conservatives remained a dominant political force, in part due to lingering political restrictions, as well as corruption. \n\n The 1969 elections were marked by a higher voter turnout than the last election. Doubts about the new constitution that had plagued the earlier 1965 elections had faded, with other sectors of the population joining the urban centers. Subsequently the small progressive surge seen in 1965 would be tempered as land-owners turned out to vote, electing their own candidates.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017634;Between 1968 and 1970 the Democratic Women's Organization of Afghanistan would involve itself in the organization and execution of several protests aimed at its perceived injustices within society. Attempts by the conservative forces in the country to reverse the freedoms and rights that had been given to women in the country, including restricting foreign education, were met with mass protests while violence by more radical traditionalist elements of society that had been angered by their own grievances would result mass movements to force government action and investigation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017635;Disaster has struck Afghanistan as one of the worst droughts in its history ravages the nation, with the threat of wide-scale famine already gripping the more remote parts of the nation. Millions are at risk of losing their lives as the government struggles to respond to the magnitude of the drought's impact, with many more left to suffer the more long-term effects. Not only is food becoming more scarce, but rising poverty, homelessness, and interruption of services wrack the nation as the economy begins to feel the effects - with years of recovery laying ahead.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017636;Hoping to help Afghanistan recover from its economic troubles and finally mount a government response to the severe famines that had resulted from the drought in 72, Mohammed Daoud Khan announced an ambitious 'Seven-Year Plan' set to take place from 1976 to 1983. The details of the plan itself involved heavy state spending on construction projects throughout the nation that were set to be funded by, what Daoud hoped, would be an influx of foreign aid from neighboring nations - especially those within the Muslim world.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017637;While initially cooperative with the moderately reformist Parchamites, even receiving aid from the group in mobilizing forces for the 1973 coup, relations soon sourced between the communists and President Mohammed Daoud Khan's ruling National Revolutionary Party. Starting just a few years after its coming to power the regime would take on an openly anti-communist attitude, cracking down and arresting prominent leftist figures within the country and taking active measures to prevent dissent against the regime. These actions would, however, only serve to weaken the already shaky Republic.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017638;Since the PDPA's creation in 1965, a massive rift within Afghanistan's communist movement has only deepened. While united together in a shared belief in socialism, the two main factions of the People's Democratic Party disagree aggressively on how to achieve it. While the 'Khalq' faction (whose name means Masses, or 'People') adhere to more orthodox Marxist-Leninist principles, the 'Parcham' faction ('Banner' or 'Flag') have maintained that Afghanistan is too underdeveloped as of yet to operate under the traditional Marxist-Leninist system - instead promoting a gradual and more democratic approach to the implementation of communism. \n\n This animosity wouldn't disappear upon the PDPA's ascent to power and the creation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Instead, the Khalqists - led by Taraki - would facilitate a 'soft' purge of the Parcham faction. The move itself would be heavily influenced by the efforts of Hafizullah Amin (another prominent Khalqist politician) whose political maneuvering elevated his own position at the cost of the rival faction.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017639;Wishing to waste little time in beginning Afghanistan's transformation from an underdeveloped nation into a socialist state, Taraki has already outlined a sweeping list of reforms, programs, projects, and campaigns aimed at accomplishing the task. Among them are large-scale literacy campaigns, land reform, the nation's first television broadcast, and several policies aimed at removing the influence of Islam from society. While the latter focus mainly on ending practices such as planned marriage, child marriage, the abolition of 'Sharia Law', and other policies deemed to be 'feudal' by the Khalqist government there is still a potential from wide-spread backlash from the more traditionalist elements of society - especially in the countryside where Islam still remains deeply rooted in culture and governance.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017640;Amin's power-grab sent ripples of unrest and instability throughout Afghanistan, and the series of repressions and purges that followed would earn him the ire of both the Khalqists, Parchamites, and Soviets alike. In the immediate aftermath of Amin's move a group of PDPA politicians who headed various ministries, calling themselves the 'Gang of Four', began making moves to themselves oust Amin from power. However, Amin's repressions would prevent even high-ranking members of the government from being able to take effective action - leading to the four members themselves being removed from government and forcing them to flee to escape further reprisal, leaving Amin even more unchecked as he continued to try to consolidate his rule.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017641;Taraki's more radical anti-Islamist policies, particularly his uncompromising opposition to Sharia law, would be met throughout the country with wide-spread resentment. This would be especially felt in the more underdeveloped and rural areas of the country that were still deeply rooted in the more fundamentalist aspects of Islam. Herat in particular was already the site of several smaller revolts and uprisings inspired by mullahs and landowners. However, it wasn't until the mutiny of forces sent in to deal with the more violent aspects that the unrest would turn into a full occupation of parts of the province by rebel forces. \n\n Chaos would ensue in the province and across the country as the DRA scrambled to respond to the scope of the unrest, with several being killed in Herat before forces were finally able to be sent in - causing further clashes before finally restoring government control.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017642;Historically having been strongholds of tribal power in Afghanistan, an offensive in the south-eastern sections of the country have proved fruitful in tackling the growing opposition to socialist rule in the country. The Afghan army, along with loyal militia groups and police forces, have managed to route several rebel groups in the nation - pushing those that didn't surrender into neighboring Pakistan as they attempt to regroup.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017643;Emboldened by the instability that happened in the wake of Amin's coup, as well as a direct reaction against it, a coalition of Maoist, moderate islamist, and anti-Soviet Marxist groups have begun an attempted insurrection in Kabul. Occupying the historical fortress of Bala Hissar, their aim is to inspire similar revolts across the nation - leading to the formation of a broad leftist government outside of the influence of the USSR and able to resist influence from neighboring regimes. Already, however, government forces have begun a swift response to their uprising, with aerial bombardment working to pave the way for ground forces.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017644;While the intervention of the Soviet Union was primarily aimed at ousting Amin from power, it proved to only fan the flames of resentment among many portions of the population to the Democratic Republic and socialist rule. Karmal, who had risen to power in the aftermath of Amin's removal, would be seen as little more than a puppet of the Soviet Union - serving to weaken his authority over the nation and even the PDPA itself. Such sentiments would prove to lesson the effectiveness of his policies and divide the nation further, radicalizing more conservatives around the growing rebel threat.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017645;The 'Fundamental Principles', also known as the 'Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan', refer to a series of changes to the government that were aimed at solidifying Parchamite rule, increasing civilian participation in governance, appeasing traditionalist elements of society - particularly those in active opposition to the regime through offers of amnesty, and restoring rule of law within the DRA. The Principles included securing a degree of freedom of speech and assembly, rules and rights for legal trial, elections, and some degree of economic liberalization.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017646;Since the PDPA's creation in 1965, a massive rift within Afghanistan's communist movement has only deepened. While united together in a shared belief in socialism, the two main factions of the People's Democratic Party disagree aggressively on how to achieve it. While the 'Khalq' faction (whose name means Masses, or 'People') adhere to more orthodox Marxist-Leninist principles, the 'Parcham' faction ('Banner' or 'Flag') have maintained that Afghanistan is too underdeveloped as of yet to operate under the traditional Marxist-Leninist system - instead promoting a gradual and more democratic approach to the implementation of communism. \n\n The restoration of the Parchamite faction following the Soviet intervention against Khalqist Amin shifted the balance of power within the PDPA significantly in favor of the former and with Karmal's ascent to power provided a chance for the dynamics of the PDPA to even further change. While professing a degree of unity initially, and attempting to share power with the Khalqists, persisting animosity would lead to small scale purges of more hardliner elements from government and the continued infighting and division of the party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017647;The '3 Hoot uprising' - whose name comes from the Persian Calendar - refers to a series of protests, spontaneous uprisings, and student demonstrations throughout Afghanistan made in opposition to Soviet intervention in the country and the leadership of Karmal. A bulk of the interconnected protests, whose initial spark is not fully known, were organized by the Maoist Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan and other Moaist organizations. The extent to the dissent would result in a backlash from the government, seeing most of the protests, riots, and unrest put down with force.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017648;Hoping to further increase participation in government and democratize Afghan society, Karmal and the Parchamites have proposed the creation of a National Front government - similar to those in other communist states. Named the 'National Fatherland Front', the National Front would serve as a coalition of parties operating within the framework of socialism and aim to give more of a voice to those that didn't wish to join or associate with the PDPA and its own inner-party institutions while still involving themselves within the politics of the DRA and working towards a shared goal of modernizing the nation. The creation of the front is set to be paired with a massive campaign to support the organization, as well as encourage more political solutions to grievances with the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017649;Amid a continued insurgency and ineffective policies, Karmal has announced the establishment of a ten-point National Reconciliation program. In order to reach this end he has already selected a range of non-PDPA members to head a committee organizing the task, as well as carrying it out across the nation. The program itself will be aimed at reaching a power-sharing settlement with rebel forces, and will come along-side further attempts to democratize Afghan society and entrench rule of law.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017650;Karmal initially enjoyed substantial support from the Soviet Union, especially at the onset of his rise to prominence following the intervention that ousted Amin from power. However, years of ineffective politics, increasing reformism within the CPSU, and an increasingly violent and prolonged insurgency has eroded the good-will and faith in Karmal from his Soviet advisors and allies. While the Afghan leader is safe for now, content to ignore calls for his resignation, his political rivals within the PDPA have already begun making their own moves for the now almost inevitable fall from power.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017651;With Karmal's departure from power comes a struggle within the PDPA for who will take the former leader's place. The main divide, as has been the case since its foundation, is between a member of the increasingly reformist Parcham faction and the adamantly hardline Khalqists. Currently the former is represented by the pro-democracy Najibullah, who enjoys substantial support within the party and from reformists within the Soviet Union, while the latter is represented by the more moderate Abdul Qadir who served within the Afghan army and within the government as Minister of Defense.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017652;Hoping to further solidify Afghanistan's democratic institutions, as well as attempt to put an end to the insurgency plaguing the country, Najibullah has announced a deepening of the country's policy of 'National Reconciliation' policies. Far more radical than previous attempts, however, Najibullah wishes to fully abolish the one-party rule, officialize Islam as the state religion, begin the process of decommunization of government institutions, create a new legislature, and open up dialogue with various factions of the rebel groups. \n\n While such policies are far-reaching, and opposed by more hardline elements with the PDPA, many more rally behind them as the only way to put an end to a conflict that has been raging for so long.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017653;While adamant in keeping some aspects of planned economics, and sticking to development plans started under his predecessor, Najibullah is seemingly not content with solely increased democratization. Instead, the new leader has proposed changes to the constitution to allow the establishment of fully private firms, as well as foreign investment. In addition to this, however, he has reaffirmed the countries ties to the communist bloc, pushing for increased trade to help support the Afghan economy and gain government support via its development and growth.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017654;The Soviet people have grown increasingly weary with the costly, and seemingly endless, war in Afghanistan. What was initially a simple mission to oust Amin and prop up more moderate voices within the PDPA has turned into a drawn-out conflict that has cost many lives and only further entrenched the very enemies we fight against. With that in mind the new Reformist leadership in the USSR had put forward a motion to end the intervention, and to start the process of withdrawing troops and funding from the regions and divert them towards more pressing concerns.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017655;The Soviet Union, now led by hardline reformists and seeing no end in sight for the conflict in Afghanistan, has decided to begin the process of withdrawing its troops from the nation. While it has pledged to continue support for the current government it has, regretfully, expressed the growing reluctance within its borders to continue direct military intervention. \n\n While the rebel groups across the country will see with withdraw as a rallying victory, the government remains hopeful in their ability to maintain order and stability through the coming months.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017656;With Soviet forces removed from the country, the reformist leadership of the PDPA - led by Najibullah - have increased their push for democratization. Already mentions of communism and socialism are being removed from the party platform, legal system, and government - with communist and socialist symbols to follow. This comes along-side yet more reforms to the nation's already shaken government, the almost complete opening of politics to wider society in a last attempt to resolve Afghanistan's problems through peaceful political means.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017657;Hoping to halt Afghanistan's current path, a strange alliance has formed in order to orchestrate a coup against the Najibullah government. Centering around a former Minister of Defense and Lt. General, Shahnawaz Tanai, several dissident Khalqists have been joined by groups within the Mujahideen in order to try to put the 'radical nationalist' into power. \n\n While unsuccessful, the means in which the coup was attempted served to destabilize the regime even further. Mujahideen groups coordinated attacks alongside the attempt, dividing the remaining army forces while other officers and officials were bribed to defect or ignore the attempt - with forces within the government also rallying behind Tanai, ultimately compromising their own positions and reopening rifts within the PDPA.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017658;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Afghanistan has lost its most effective tool in fighting the Mujahideen - the Airforce. With fuel shortages now grounding most aircraft, strikes across the country are impossible, transport of mechanized weaponry has become much more difficult, and offensives across the country are being made unopposed - with more and more of the nation being lost with each passing week. Without a swift end to the conflict, Afghanistan's fall is almost assured.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017659;Defections and desertions plague what little remains of the Afghan army as they put up a vain defense against the Mujahideen who now stand poised to take the capital and finally achieve their goal of overthrowing the Republic of Afghanistan. Their forces, already within striking distance, have faced little resistance as major commanders abandon their posts - taking troops with them as they turn to warlordism. The only hope remains in what few soldiers stand their ground, and the police and militia groups that has taken up arms in support of the government or fear for a future under the Mujahideen.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017660;While the factions, organizations, groups, and people that would coalesce to form the Taliban existed prior to the collapse of the communist regime in Afghanistan - it wouldn't be until around 1994 that sect would officially come into existence in a bid to overthrow the new government in Kabul. Made up primarily of the groups that rejected the Peshawar Accords the established the transitional 'Islamic State of Afghanistan', they soon came to pose themselves as more radical adherents to Islam, espousing even more extremist and hardline rhetoric inspired by strains that had bled into the country from throughout the Muslim World.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017661;While the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is all but complete, splits in the movement and a reorganization of opposition forces have led to an insurrection against the hardline Islamist regime. Declaring themselves the 'Northern Alliance', several warlords, Islamist figures, former Mujahideen fighters, businessmen, and even former members of the Afghan Army have joined forces to create a rival government and re-establish a more moderate rule in Kabul. Finding support abroad, its likely that their actions will prolong Afghanistan's instability for more years to come.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017662;While the American invasion has put into power more moderate elements of the Islamist movement, and made promises of democracy, it has not been met with the wide-spread acceptance it had anticipated. Instead, many more traditional minded portions of the population have vocally put themselves in opposition to American involvement in the nation's affairs, with many more pushed to the fringe of political life in the country or directly impacted by the bombing campaigns that preceded it.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017663;During the initial American invasion of Afghanistan Taliban forces were driven from the country, however it did not put an end to the group in its entirety. Monopolizing off of anti-American sentiment and the unpopularity of the current regime the Taliban have announced their reorganization, launching a pamphlet campaign in various rural towns and cities in the hope to recruit more to their cause and once again drive what they see as a foreign invader out.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017664;Following the United States invasion of Afghanistan the Northern Alliance - a disparate group of warlords pushed out of Kabul by the Taliban - were once again installed as the country's governing body. They would quickly reform a transitional government, this time acting far more quickly than before in working towards creating a new government - a task that was complicated further by the return of the still somewhat popular Monarch deposed in 1973. While this would cause the debate to ultimately be between a restoration of a constitutional monarchy or a continuation of Afghanistan as a republic - American pressure would result in the former outcome being dismissed by even the former King himself, giving rise to the later 'Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017665;Afghanistan's 2004 presidential elections marked the first in the nation following the declaration of the Islamic Republic. While mired by accusations of fraud and corruption, interventions from both the United Nations and several European countries would satisfy most of the opposition within the nation. The main candidates, elected via a two-round system, were the conservative backed independent Hamid Karzai and the more populist-leaning Yunus Qanuni and his 'New Afghanistan' party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017666;'Ostalgia', or 'Ostalgie' - made up from the German words 'Ost' and 'Nostalgie' - describes a phenomena in the post-communist states that encompasses a wide rage of favorable outlooks on the previous communist regimes in those nations. While taking different forms in different places, having different motivations, and being both manipulated by and viewed in different lights by various political groups and portions of the population - its effect on the mindset and culture of the nations and peoples that experience it is hard to ignore. Across much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc the so-called 'Ostalgia' would go on to inspire voting patterns, art, culture, and even the rise of new organizations and ideologies. \n\n In Afghanistan, while more faint than in countries that had experienced far more stability under communism, feelings of nostalgia for the former rule of the PDPA (and later Watan Party) would persist - experiencing a boon following the Western intervention in the country and the restoration of some semblance of a republic. Mainly taking root among those that had faced persecution by the Taliban and former Mujahedeen as well as those that remembered better times under communism, Ostalgia in Afghanistan would see the revival and reorganization of several communist parties and groups - all with the common aim of once more trying to bring socialism and stability to the war-torn nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017667;With their phase of reorganization complete, the Taliban have once again started their insurgency in earnest. Already $Year$ has been marked with increased violence against the regime, especially those in positions of authority in the government. Bombing campaigns, propaganda initiatives, and uprisings degrading the already weakened faith in the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017668;Afghanistan's 2009 elections would prove a massive departure from the previous elections in 2004. Whereas previously accusations of fraud and corruption were sated with intervention from abroad, the newest elections are proving to be a series of disasters. Fraud, bribery, violence, and more are among the multiple accusations - with the results being met with skepticism from most of the nation while the government adamantly denies any wrong-doing. The two main candidates, each taking their own separate issue with the accusations, are Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah of the more centrist leaning United National Front.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017669;Burhanuddin Rabbani today was killed at his residence amid the celebrating of his 72nd birthday party. A leading figure of the Mujahideen, he would later go on to be President of Afghanistan from the collapse of the Najibullah regime until the end of the transitional period that proclaimed the Islamic Republic. \n\n Rabbani was the victim of a suicide bombing carried out by members of the Taliban who had approached him claiming to be peace delegates from the group coming to bring him an important message from the organization's leadership. Reports say the men approached him before embracing him and detonating bombs they carried. The blast also resulted in several other fatalities, and will likely only serve to further embolden the group going forward.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017670;The 2014 elections in Afghanistan, like those prior, would be wrought with allegations of fraud. They'd pit the vocally nationalist and anti-communist Ashraf Ghani against the centrist National Coalition's choice of Abdullah Abdullah.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017671;The 2019 elections in Afghanistan would once again lead to a face-off between Ghani and Abdullah, with the aftermath setting the motion for a political crisis in the nation. While initially attempts to mediate between the two figures were unsuccessful, eventually a power-sharing arrangement was reached in which both retained significant power in the nation - though effectively the outright winner would retain the office of the presidency.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017672;The President today has met with top advisors to work out the final details of a US exit from Afghanistan. While the war has been raging on for nearly 20 years, with trillions spent on it and many lives lost, the mission has become increasingly unpopular with the American public that sees the conflict as another 'endless war' that has done little to improve their lives or America's position on the world stage. \n\n Already preliminary agreements have been made with several groups in Afghanistan, notably the Taliban, to help facilitate the withdraw of those loyal to the US or its own citizens and troops - with many more assurances being made by both sides. Even still, there are those within the government, media, and corporate structures of the US that have been vocal in expressing their displeasure at the idea of an end to the conflict being floated around - a myriad of different arguments being used to try to sway an increasingly weary public back in favor of an even more prolonged American presence.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017673;The US today has begun a large-scale withdraw from the country. Already a bulk of their forces have either retreated to the capital of Kabul or outright evacuated from the country - with many more officials, advisors, generals, soldiers, and citizens soon to follow. While the speed with which events are moving along has alarmed some within the government, many - including the United States itself - are confident that Afghanistan's armed forces with their superior numbers and equipment will be able to perform the duty of America's own soldiers in holding the line against any opportunistic move made by the Taliban.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017674;Despite the confidence in the American-trained Afghan military, the Taliban have made several gains in the past few days - province after province falling to their forces. Even still Afghan forces have continued to try to regroup and hold the line - steadily moving further and further towards Kabul as worries spread throughout the heart of Afghanistan for the future of the Islamic Republic.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017675;Taliban forces have amassed outside of Kabul, with heavy fighting taking place between what few forces having surrendered, deserted, or been killed and the various disparate militia bands aligned with the fundamentalist group. Already many within the city have braced for defeat, traditional dress returning, traces of western culture being erased or hidden, symbols of the old regime taken down or destroyed, and government officials fleeing the nation - further adding to the chaotic situation. The only hope that remains of what little is left of the government now seems to rest solely with the assurances of amnesty by the Taliban - eager to do little to threaten their impending victory.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017676;The few remnants of the Afghan army and government, working together with disparate other groups, have amassed themselves north of Kabul in the Panjshir Valley. Hoping to put up a last stand against Taliban rule the group is led by many of the same figures that led the previous 'Northern Alliance', with the same goal in mind. While there is little faith that they'll be able to stand up to the Taliban, with the rest of Afghanistan having already fallen, the main threat they pose is a rallying cry for those still loyal to the old regime in the country - their more hardline officials already calling for popular uprisings across the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100100;In accordance with the constitution of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, elections are set to be held - with the predominant political forces already vying for influence. Like most elections that had taken place prior in the Kingdom of Afghanistan, the two main forces would be conservatives - finding their base among the remote regions of the nation and landowners - and the Progressives and social democratic monarchists whose base of support tended to be within urban centers, and especially the capital of Kabul.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100101;Even several long years later the drought and famine from the start of the decade continue to send ripples through Afghan society. Millions are still in poverty, faith in the government has declined massively, attempted coups and insurrections have corroded stability, and authoritarianism and corruption run rampant. Through it all, however, Afghanistan's Kingdom has endured. Now, however, we are faced with a decision to begin to finally tackle some of the more long-standing issues. Progressive elements within the government have made the proposal for an even more radical alteration of the previous constitution - stripping more power from the king and even further enshrining democratic institutions within the country. \n\n While something so bold would surely upset the more traditionalist elements of society, unrest is bound to grow no matter the action as forces continue to gather and mobilize for change in the country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100102;While the King and government have, in the past, worked to temper and limit their reforms - as well as make concessions to the various tribal and underdeveloped regions of Afghanistan - in order to appease the more conservative-minded population, it was only a matter of time before the modernization efforts provoked wide-spread backlash. Opposing what they see as a trampling of tradition and foreign influence within the nation many have spoken out against more progressive elements of the government, and society - attempting to rally further support against Afghanistan's continued march to modernization, including by the use of force.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100103;Afghanistan mourns today with the passing of its late king, Mohammed Zahir Shah. Widely considered the 'Father of the Nation', the late monarch led Afghanistan through the first steps towards modernization and democratization. He is succeeded by his son, Ahmad Shah Khan, who will take his father's place and hopefully continue the legacy left behind.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100104;After decades of gradual change and pragmatic reform, Afghanistan has finally fully entered the modern era. With a majority of the population having embraced progressive values, the Monarch's power limited by a democratic constitution, and a functioning and thriving government in place with stable foundations we can finally move forward with the country's continued development as a shining beacon to all of Central Asia and the wider Islamic world.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100105;Even before the attempted coup, the Republic was far from stable. Despite efforts to have combated the more radical conservative strains of Islam the threat of reaction only grew during the initial economic and political instability brought on by Daoud's seizure of power. Now with tensions having mounted and opposition having reorganized it seems that things have finally boiled over into violence - with remains of the old social order, particularly among the tribes, joining forces with other conservative elements to bring about an end to the rule of the National Revolutionary Party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100106;The two dominant factions of the PDPA have long been divided - split by their ideological differences, with infighting and sectarianism having served only to undermine their drive towards a socialist Afghanistan. However, today it seems they have decided to put those differences aside in another attempt to oust Daoud from power and spark the fires of revolution in Afghanistan. While currently police and military forces have dealt with the more violent uprisings, there remains a threat of a potential communist insurgency.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100107;With rebels having stormed Kabul today, the old regime has effectively been put to an end. As such its institutions and policies are to be stripped away and replaced anew.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100108;The results of the 'Seven-Year Plan' have finally come to fruition, with Afghanistan's weakened economy now on the upturn after a decade. Massive public spending in developing infrastructure, healthcare, industrialization, institutional modernization, and more have left millions that had been cast into poverty and left abandoned by the former Kingdom with newfound jobs and purpose in society - with the efforts also significantly helping to strengthen the still shaky stability of the Republic. With any luck, this will mark a chance in Afghanistan's fortunes.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100109;Having overseen the stabilization of both Afghanistan's new Republic and its economy, Mohammed Daoud Khan has announced today his retirement. With his age slowly catching up to him he entrusts leadership of the Republic to his son, Tariq Daoud Khan, who will surely follow in the footsteps of his father under his nominal guidance and continue to pave the way to a more modern Afghanistan.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100110;With growing support among the population for the communist government, what remains of the Mujahideen have been declared defeated. Their numbers declining, their operations and offensives growing more and more scarce, and their propaganda failing to an ever more progressive population it is likely that the rebel organization will not survive for much longer. Such a turn of events finally opens the door for Afghanistan's march into the future, and an end to a bloody era of its history.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100111;With the defeat of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, Soviets soldiers have begun to finally return to their homeland in triumph. While some forces, and military bases, will be kept in the nation to ensure further cooperation with the now stabilized regime a vast majority of the resources that had been poured into the country can now be diverted else-where.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100112;Despite what the world has been shown thus far, Afghanistan is a rich nation with the potential to outpace even the Gulf States in its economic output. While this treasure trove of resources have gone untapped thus far, we are finally ready to enter the modern era as a developed nation. Throughout the country operations are already underway to extract resources such as coal, iron, gold, uranium, and more - mineral reserves that are estimated to far exceed most other countries' own in value.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100113;While Taraki has served as the leader of Afghanistan faithfully and loyally for nearly a decade now - many within the PDPA feel the time has come for the aging head of government to make way for a replacement. While unified for the most part, with divisions and rifts far more minimal than before the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, there still remains fierce disagreement on which faction should be able to nominate a successor. While the Khalqists have pointed to Gulabzoy, holding a level of influence second only to Taraki himself within the party, the Parchamites have put forward a more controversial choice, Anahita Ratebzad. Head of the People's Organization of Afghan Women, Ratebzad is held up as a prominent figure who has been involved in the politics of the nation - including political organization - since prior to the coup in 73. While a woman leader would likely be seen as an insult to many traditional members of Afghan society - Parchamites are confident that her abilities would be enough to secure the rule of the DRA within the country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100114;After the initial period of intense repression and declining political and civil rights, the Amin government today has announced a new policy known as the 'Fundamental Principles'. While now as liberal or robust as his remaining rivals within the PDPA, the policies within outline some degree of a return to rule of law, minor freedom of expression, amnesty for certain prisoners, and the foundations of a constitution for the young state.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100115;While it was the Soviets that initially supported Amin's ouster, the fact remains that Afghanistan has few countries willing to provide aid and arms to combat its growing internal unrest. As such, in a pragmatic move, Amin has proposed more closely aligning with the Soviet Union and attempting to improve the now strained relations between the two nations. \n\n Though some within the PDPA's more fringe factions have suggested approaching the west for assistance instead - though in the long run this could weaken Afghanistan's autonomy all the same as well as earn it more ire from its neighbors in the region who wish to stave off American influence.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100116;After ruling Afghanistan as its unquestioned leader for years, it has been announced that the Supreme Leader of Afghanistan has passed today. While a mourning period was declared across the country the PDPA quickly scrambled to liberalize the party institutions, political rivals already returning to the country from their positions abroad to vie for leadership. Two have risen above the rest, however. Watanjar, who participated in an attempted coup against Amin and served as member of the Khalqist government under Taraki prior to the coup and Karmal, the de facto leader of the Parcham faction and a favored of Moscow who is likely to result in an alignment of the country into the Soviet sphere.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100117;While the position of women in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is equal to that of men, with traditionalist and religious laws being abolished and cultural norms being actively challenged, much of the nation's women remain oppressed under reactionary ideas. To this end, Ratebzad has begun a mass campaign throughout the nation to mobilize women throughout the country towards the goal of driving reactionary forces from the country and working to build socialism. Already hundreds of young working class folks have been swayed by the rhetoric and speeches - with many choosing to join the Afghan army outright to help liberate their sisters still in bondage.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100118;Anahita Ratebzad, like much of her fellow Parchamites, holds the view that the material conditions within Afghanistan necessitate market reforms and a degree of political liberalization. While such reforms are likely to be heavily tempered by the Khalqists, smaller scale economic reforms as well as a solidifying of rule of law are likely to face little opposition - and will likely go a long way to legitimizing the regime.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100119;Reactionary thought persists within Afghan society, particularly among the areas with less access to education and regions that have been affected by poverty and a lack of social services in the past. In an effort to combat these Ratebzad has proposed the implementation of a large-scale propaganda campaign that target these areas - hoping to win over the minds of the people and bring new ideas to combat the old ways that have governed the country for centuries.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100120;Conditions within Afghanistan continue to deteriorate, with the Mujahideen continuing their insurgency and uprisings and protests occurring throughout the country. This is despite the best efforts of Anahita Ratebzad, already a controversial figure for leading a traditional Islamic society as a woman, to put the nation on the path towards socialism. Monopolizing on her perceived failures and growing unpopularity within the party many have already made their moves to push for her replacement. Two candidates from each of the dominant factions in the PDPA have emerged.  Karmal, a pro-Moscow Parchamite and reformist and Gulabzoy who leads the more fiery Khalqist faction.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100121;The time has come to elect a new leader for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The choice is likely to be between candidates put forward by one of the two dominant factions of the PDPA - a reformist Parchamite and a support of democratization and liberalization, or a hardline Khalqist that will continue to legacy of the revolution. Whatever the choice, it is likely to define Afghan politics going forward, emboldening one faction while leading to a weakening of the other.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100122;While nominally aligned with the Khalq faction of the PDPA, Abdul Qadir - one of the leading figures in bringing about the Socialist State in Afghanistan, has announced intentions to work towards a campaign within the party aimed at unifying the disparate factions and providing some semblance of cooperation between various government branches. Many members of both factions, however, remain skeptical of any attempt at reconciliation - worried to lose influence or of ending up in a situation like the numerous before. Even still, there are those that see hope in the move - while it would be costly in the short-term, stability within the PDPA would mean more effective policies and free up resources to focus on tackling more pressing issues.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100123;Afghanistan is a country under siege from both within and abroad. While KHAD, the state security agency of Afghanistan, can be tasked with handling the external threats - the issue of the Mujahideen and other rebel groups remains domestically. In an effort to both bolster the armed forces of Afghanistan and encourage public action against the enemies of the revolution, Qadir has announced drives to ramp up recruitment in the Armed Forces as well as to establish militia groups in major provinces to mobilize supporters of the Democratic Republic against the forces of reaction.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100124;With a more military minded and hardline leader in charge, diplomatic and political solutions to Afghanistan's conflict have been set aside in favor of military action against the forces seeking to overthrow the Democratic Republic. However, Afghanistan's military is already stretched thin with keeping order in the country - and any operations will likely have to be relegated to a single section of the country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100125;The time has come to elect a new leader for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The choice is likely to be between candidates put forward by one of the two dominant factions of the PDPA - a reformist Parchamite and a support of democratization and liberalization, or a hardline Khalqist that will continue to legacy of the revolution. Whatever the choice, it is likely to define Afghan politics going forward, emboldening one faction while leading to a weakening of the other.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100126;While few within the PDPA want to openly admit to it, fighting off the Mujahideen - themselves being supported by foreign actors - will prove to be a losing battle if waged by Afghanistan alone. It is to that end that some have suggested asking the Soviet Union to provide military assistance. While such a move could prove unpopular - and put the country firmly under Soviet influence - it may be the only way to ensure long-term stability.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100127;In light of Karmal's declining health, the time has come to elect a new leader for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The choice is likely to be between candidates put forward by one of the two dominant factions of the PDPA - a reformist Parchamite and a support of democratization and liberalization, or a hardline Khalqist that will continue to legacy of the revolution. Whatever the choice, it is likely to define Afghan politics going forward, emboldening one faction while leading to a weakening of the other.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While such a move could prove unpopular - and put the country firmly under Soviet influence - it may be the only way to ensure long-term stability.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100129;With Khalqists becoming the dominant force in the divided PDPA, the question as arisen which policy should be taken within the government in relation to its rival Parcham faction. While several more hardline elements would see little issue in continuing the marginalization of the more reformist leaning members of the party - several more voices have spoken up in favor of a more moderate approach, instead focusing on unity within the party to put an end to infighting that could hamper the implementation of policies and responses to the numerous domestic issues plaguing the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100130;Seeing a prolonged conflict in Afghanistan, one that has cost the Soviet Union lives and resources, there has begun a campaign to pressure for Gulabzoy removal from his positions of leadership within the party. Instead, the reformists in the CPSU - now leading the nation - hope that a more moderate figure might be able to work towards a political or diplomatic solution to the conflict within the embattled country. Already a candidate has come forward in the form of Najibullah, a reformist member of the Parcham faction who has outlined a policy of 'National Reconciliation' in hopes of legitimizing the government in the eyes of the rebel groups. However, not everyone in the party - or in the Soviet Union - sees a radical change as the best course. Abdul Qadir, one of the leading figures in the Saur Revolution, has also come forward as a potential - more stable - replacement. His policies would be far more moderate, in line with the already dominant Khalqists and focused instead on a continued military end to the rebellion.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100131;The time has come to elect a new leader for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The choice is likely to be between candidates put forward by one of the two dominant factions of the PDPA - a reformist Parchamite and a support of democratization and liberalization, or a hardline Khalqist that will continue to legacy of the revolution. Whatever the choice, it is likely to define Afghan politics going forward, emboldening one faction while leading to a weakening of the other.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100132;Even before the Saur Revolution that brought communists to power, the PDPA was a divided party and socialism in Afghanistan a fractured movement rife with infighting. However, that is to be put to an end today. Watanjar, along with other moderates within the government, have put forward the idea of launching an internal campaign of unity within the party aimed at bringing the two disparate factions more inline with a centralized coherent ideology both can rally around and worth within.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100133;With a more military minded and hardline leader in charge, diplomatic and political solutions to Afghanistan's conflict have been set aside in favor of military action against the forces seeking to overthrow the Democratic Republic. However, Afghanistan's military is already stretched thin with keeping order in the country - and any operations will likely have to be relegated to a single section of the country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100134;With the passing of Watanjar, the time has come to elect a new leader for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The choice is likely to be between candidates put forward by one of the two dominant factions of the PDPA - a reformist Parchamite and a support of democratization and liberalization, or a hardline Khalqist that will continue to legacy of the revolution. Whatever the choice, it is likely to define Afghan politics going forward, emboldening one faction while leading to a weakening of the other.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100135;At various times Tanai has been described as a 'radical nationalist', something that has been used against him in the past. However, with him now at the helm of Afghanistan's government, it has been turned into a tool. Hoping to foster a stronger sense of national pride and instill a more powerful civic national identity - a campaign has been started to restore certain symbols of the past, as well as to loosen restrictions on certain elements of traditionalism within the nation. While not everyone within the PDPA is onboard with these changes, many more agree that such superficial policies could legitimize the government all the same.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100136;With Shahnawaz Tanai's coup a success, the leader and his allies have started acting quickly in planning on moves to further cement their power. The Parcham faction still holds significant power within the party, and likely are themselves already planning to make a counter move against Tanai - who is more aligned with the hardline elements of the Khalq faction. Many in Tanai's inner circle believe it would be wise to preempt any attempt to work against the new Afghan leader, removing and replacing problematic politicians within the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100137;The factions of the Mujahideen that helped with Tanai's coup have come to collect the debts owed to them. As per the arrangements with the more moderate sections of the rebel movement, power-sharing agreements, policy concessions, and a détente with several other groups have been fully implemented. While its likely to cause some instability in the short-term, it much of the rebel movement laying down their arms or outright rallying behind the government could prove to be a tipping point for the conflict in Afghanistan.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100138;With a more military minded and hardline leader in charge, diplomatic and political solutions to Afghanistan's conflict have been set aside in favor of military action against the forces seeking to overthrow the Democratic Republic.

EVTDESC80100141;The situation in the communist bloc continues to look dire, with increasing liberalization in the USSR bleeding over into the republics of the Warsaw Pact - leading to destabilization and unrest that threatens the foundations of many of the Eastern Bloc nations. Through it all Afghanistan's government has been left helpless to intervene with its still limited resources, able to do little more than maintain trade ties while they can last and navigate the changing geo-political landscape. \n\n However, there is one country that is within reach of Afghanistan's influence. The Minister of State Security has submitted a proposal to send agents from KHAD to the Mongolian People's Republic in order to help restore order and hopefully preserve socialism within the country. While such a feat strains the abilities of the state security agency, securing a communist ally in Asia would go a long way in helping to protect the revolution within our own country.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100142;With the transitional Islamic State having been able to hold out against Taliban forces, the disorganized government has finally been able to focus on the matter of determining the future of the state. While many want to retain control over a much more centralized and fundamentalist autocracy - there are many more voices that call for the establishment of a republic modeled along Islamic principles, and importantly aligned itself with the Western powers responsible for the Mujahideen's initial rise.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100143;After decades of bloody conflict, peace has finally returned to Afghanistan. Many throughout the nation rejoice at news of the Taliban's defeat, what little remains of the organization broken and scattered - its leadership either dead, surrendered, or arrested. The government itself has issued a statement of its victory, putting forward promises of now turning its attention towards tackling more long-standing issues in the nation, working to tackle poverty, corruption, and to continue efforts to modernize the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022914;Despite the People's Uprising in 1944 that brought an end to Bulgaria's involvement with the Axis powers and saw the rise of socialist and communist forces in the country - the nation has officially remained a Kingdom. That is set to change now, however, two years later. A referendum on the status of the Monarchy is set to be held on the anniversary of the uprising against it, with projections indicating a landslide victory on the part of those that wish to see Bulgaria move into a new future as a Republic.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022915;The Civil War in Greece rages on, now entering into its third - and possibly final - phase. While there was a brief glimmer of hope for compromise and a peaceful transition of the country towards socialism - the former anti-fascist partisans have since found themselves struggling against the oppressive and reactionary forces of the Kingdom that seek to preserve their interests. However, they shall not fight alone. Our nation is in a position to intervene - at least indirectly - in the conflict. While it remains to be seen if such actions would turn the tide, we can be sure that an allied Greece would greatly benefit our  burgeoning socialist alliance and further the cause of world revolution.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022916;After an abrupt bout of illness, Dimitrov has passed away today while receiving treatment in Moscow. While his time in office was brief, plans have already been made to construct a mausoleum in his honor, with other funeral arrangements and events planned in coming days. However, his unexpected passing has left the politics on the nation somewhat shaken. As the dust settles, two figures have emerged to lead Bulgaria forward. The party has elected one of them, Chervenkov - a staunchly pro-Stalinist figure - to take the position of General Secretary while the more moderate Kolarov has been elected to the post of Chair of the Council of Ministers.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022917;Since the split between Yugoslavia and the USSR, the animosity between the two nations has only grown, boiling over into the Eastern Bloc as they are steered away from closer economic and political integration with the former. Nowhere has this been felt more than in Bulgaria, where many within the BCP hold fondness for Tito and his ideals and see Soviet influence within the nation as stifling. \n\n Given the state of affairs and Soviet influence in the nation, many - especially among the more hardline elements of the party - believe it would be wise to crack down on both these 'Titoists' within the party as well as the more radical 'Home Communists'. Already a vocal member of the movement, Traicho Kostov - described as a nationalist, has been targeted along with his allies.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022918;With the passing of Koarov, who held the post of Chair of the Council of Ministers, Bulgaria's period of 'collective leadership' has seeming fallen apart. While such an event would result in a new Chair being elected by the National Assembly, or the Council itself, Cherenkov and his allies have started making moves to ensure the post falls to Cherenkov himself - who already occupies the position of General Secretary of the party. Such a move would give the vocal Stalinist a large amount of sway over the nation, though few within the party would see the move in a positive light - preferring to keep the posts separate as well as to stave off the influence of Stalinism in Bulgaria.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022919;Chervenkov has come to earn himself the nickname of 'Little Stalin' within Bulgaria for his zealotry to upholding 'Stalinism'. As such, he has begun to attempt to build for himself a cult of personality in the same vein as the Soviet leader he wishes to emulate - cracking down even more on dissent and attempting to empower himself even more within the apparatuses of the party, and beyond. Of course, such actions are likely to have the same effect as they did within the USSR - and many within the party are likely to take issue with an even harder Stalinist bend.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022920;In Bulgaria the 'New Course' would mark a period of economic growth and industrialization - as well as the exploitation of more of the nation's mineral wealth and natural resources.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022921;Chervenkov's open praise and idolization of Stalin has earned him increasing ire within the Bulgarian Communist Party. Attempts to further consolidate power into his own hands, undermine the institutions of the People's Republic, and purge opposition within the party all working to rob what little support he had within the nation. It was only support from Stalin himself that has, up until this point, provided any stability to his hold on power. However, with Stalin's passing Chervenkov has been left with few allies, and many within the party eager to see him removed from office. Already two voices have risen within the opposition - Zhivkov, who represents a more moderate faction within the party and Yugov who represents the remaining 'Home Communists' who seek a more Bulgarian path towards socialism and a distancing from the Soviet line. \n\n Of course, even without many allies, the strict Stalinist policies of Chervenkov have still left the leader with tools to use to cling to power against opposition - though its likely such actions would draw the ire of the USSR.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022922;Chervenkov's open praise and idolization of Stalin has earned him increasing ire within the Bulgarian Communist Party. Even with his attempts to purge opposition and consolidate power largely blocked, his efforts to undermine the institution of the people's republic have never-the-less left him with few allies. Up until this point, however, his removal from power was out of the question due to his support from Stalin. With the Soviet leader's passing, the opportunity to make a move against Chervenkov has finally presented itself. \n\n Many of the most vocal opponents, such as Yugov and Kostov, are members of the 'Home Communist' faction that seek greater independence from the Soviet line and closer relations with Yugoslavia. Of course, more moderate members of the BCP have put forward their own candidate in Zhivkov.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022923;Hoping to cling to power in the absence of his long-term ally, the late leader Stalin, Chervenkov has today instated a coup within the ranks of the BCP. Such a move has lead to wide-spread repression and instability throughout the nation - actions that threaten both the Bulgarian people and the rest of the Eastern Bloc. As such, many within the CPSU are requesting that the USSR intervene to depose this self-professed Stalinist and allow a more moderate leader to rise in his place.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022924;With Soviet authority restored in Bulgaria and Chervenkov's powergrab at an end, the BCP - with Soviet approval - has reinstated its rule over the nation and put forward Zhivkov to lead the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022925;The April Line, or April Plenum, was envisioned as part of Bulgaria's process of De-Stalinization. Mostly revolving around the new line within the USSR in the wake of Stalin's death, the April line would set the party line moving forward and heavily emphasized the principles of shared leadership within the communist system as well as providing a strong rebuke of most of the ideas associated with Stalinism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022926;Even before the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR, Bulgaria had aspirations of its own for the creation of a space program. While the initial attempts to create such an agency, dependent on Soviet funding for their scope at the time, had been flatly rejected in the post-war climate the founding of such agencies in the USSR and its accomplishments would see renewed interest from Bulgarian intellectuals, the BCP, and even the army. \n\n Wanting to further build on this renewed interest, Air Force Captain Haralampiev and an engineer named Asparuhov would petition and meet with various members of Bulgarian society and government - eventually culminating on the establishment of the 'Bulgarian Astronautical Society', which itself would become the first such agency in the history of the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022927;Originally a member of the resistance against Axis-aligned Bulgaria and German forces stationed in the country, Elena Lagadinova earned herself a reputation as being one the youngest such partisans. However, it wasn't until after the war that her most famous feats would come to light. \n\n Taking advantage of the new regime and the freedom and stability that came with it she would shift her focus to the sciences. Legadinova would go on to earn a PhD in agribiology, joining the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences not long after where her expertise would go on to lead her to produce a more productive strain of wheat that greatly benefited the nation's agricultural output. Such a discovery would see her awarded the 'Order of Cyril and Methods' by the government and bring her even more into the public eye.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022928;Hoping to fight against what he considered to be signs of a 'cult of personality', government 'excesses', and more abusive officials - Zhivkov put forward the idea of starting a campaign within the party and government of actively fighting against such things. Even going so far as to order any statue that had been build of himself to be removed, he hoped the moves - combined with the rehabilitation and reinstatement of figures purged under Chervenkov and a increase in cultural freedoms - would boost support for the government as well as control of more moderate voices within the BCP.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022929;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022930;Hoping to make use of the mobile automatic phone that had been invented just a few years prior by Kupriyanovich in the USSR, Radioelektronika, a Bulgarian enterprise, presented its own designs and plans for the invention within Bulgaria. Starting with a single station in the capital, Radioelektronika hoped to spread its services throughout the nation - connection the nation with the new technology and further expanding upon it in the process.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022931;The April Conspiracy refers to a planned coup against Bulgarian leader Zhivkov by radical Stalinist and Maoist elements within the BCP that perceived the revisionism of the General Secretary. The plot was led by Ivan Todorov-Gorunya and Tsolo Krastev in tandem with multiple elements of the Bulgarian military - though ultimately the plans would be discovered before they were executed and those that had involved themselves in it were swiftly arrested.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022932;Bulgaria has been cast into a state of chaos after a recent coup against Zhivkov. According to reports, elements of the party, influenced by Maoism, have ousted what they claim were 'revisionist' leaders within the nation during a largely bloodless coup. The apparent leader of the coup, the hardline Todorov-Gorunya, has already started repressions against those speaking against the move - with a return to the days of Chervenkov looming over Bulgaria. Many within the party think it would be wise to intervene to put an end to this administration before it can cement its rule - restoring the elected leaders back to their posts and ensuring that more moderate voices prevail within the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022933;With Soviet authority restored in Bulgaria and the attempted Stalinist coup at an end, the BCP - with Soviet approval - has reinstated its rule over the nation and put forward Zhivkov to lead the nation once more.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022934;Frustrated by what she perceived as interference within Bulgarian science by those without technical expertise and political influence within the sciences in general, Elena Lagadinova - already well known for her contributions to agricultural science - has petitioned the government with a complaint regarding the matter. \n\n Initially hoping to field her complaints, and recommendations, directly to the USSR - her letter would be intercepted and presented to Zhivkov. In response, Zhivkov moved to present Lagadinova with a ranking position within the party as president of the 'Fatherland Front' coalition that lead the nation, as well as to place her at the helm of the 'Bulgarian Women's Movement' - two positions that would enable her to not only ensure her recommendations were followed through but lead even more sweeping change in nation - and the larger world through participation in the Women's International Democratic Federation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022935;Inspired by the advent of Computer technology around the world, and having recently devised its own designs based on those in other nations - Bulgaria is poised to earn itself the title of 'Silicon Valley of the Eastern Bloc', becoming one of the foremost nations in the communist world for the production of computers and technological innovation in the field. While obviously this would require a massive initial investment by the government, many feel that the so-called 'cybernetisation' of the nation is the path forward for the socialist world.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022936;In an effort to combat the growing liberal movement within the Bulgarian Communist party, as well as revisionist tendencies such as Eurocommunism, Zhivkov and the moderates within the party conducted a small-scale purge of vocal reformists within the party - expelling both they and their supporters through 1977 and 1978, as well as reorganizing the structures of the party itself.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022937;Bulgaria's 'New Economic Mechanism' referred to a series of minor market reforms implemented throughout the nation. The exact policies were heavily inspired by those that had been undertaken earlier in the USSR itself, primarily focusing on a relaxing of price controls and more decentralization in the economy. The initial impact was a period of economic growth and an increase in popularity for the regime - as well as a stabilization of the still growing industrial economy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022938;The 'Revival Process', also known as the 'Process of Rebirth' was a forced assimilation campaign conducted in Bulgaria primarily targeting the Muslim and Turkish populations within the nation. Seen mainly as a nationalist undertaking, the campaign sought to 're-Christianize' elements of the country that - by more hardline nationalists within Bulgaria - had been themselves forcibly converted to Islam during the occupation by the Ottoman Empire. The actions that followed during the campaign would be met with wide-spread backlash from both the Muslim communities in Bulgaria as well as the reformist wing of the BCP - serving to only deepen the divide in the party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022939;With a new generation of those with technical expertise well on the way and already emerging into the workforce, and 'Cyberisation' proving a success, many within the party feel the time has come to begin the process of economic automation. While likely to be slow at first, hopes that it will prove to be the economic model of socialism moving forward and lead to an overall more prosperous Bulgaria outweigh potential fears over the new technology.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022940;Change has swept across the USSR, and the Eastern Bloc at large. Now at the helm of politics, the prominent reformist politician Gorbachev has started the campaigns of 'Perestroika' and 'Glasnost' aiming to bring what the reformists have long claimed are needed reforms to its structures and institutions. \n\n While many, including Zhivkov himself, have their reservations about the reforms - they have none-the-less begun plans to carefully replicate them within the country. However, not everyone in the BCP is quite as cautious. Reformists, long stifled under the moderate regime, have pushed for a fully endorsement and imitation of the reforms - hoping to guide Bulgaria towards a more western-oriented style of communism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022941;Decree Number 56 was an order made by the Zhivkov administration primarily focused on market reforms in the nation. While the initial limited replication of reforms in the USSR had brought some minor change - the growing pressure to continue with reforms in the wake of the Soviet withdraw, as well as the backing of the BCP's more liberal minded elements, meant that further reforms were all but ensured.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022942;With the situation in Bulgaria rapidly deteriorating, and the 'Revival Process' leading to increasing unrest in minority and Muslim communities - a drastic plan has been laid out by the regime. Called the 'Big Excursion', the plan calls for the opening of the border with Turkey in order to facilitate emigration of Turks from Bulgaria to the nation. \n\n However, reformists are furious over the plan - decrying it as genocide, while many more within the party worry that a mass exodus of people from Bulgaria and into Turkey would not only draw the ire of the Turkish regime but also rob Bulgaria of much-needed workforce. In either way, one thing is clear - the 'Revival Process' has drawn has led to an increasing animosity between the Muslim population and the ruling regime - with the most vocal dissent now emerging from the southern and eastern portions of the nation where they reside.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022943;Despite Zhivkov's removal and commitments to elections and the introduction of more western style freedoms in the nation - unrest within Bulgaria has only grown. Protests and strikes spread across the nation as the reformists scramble to enact further reforms, making use of their newfound position of authority while it lasts.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022944;Mladenov, along with other top leaders, have put forward the decision today to end the BCP's right to rule and govern over Bulgaria. Along side the announcement comes the end of the People's Republic, and a return to a 'Republic of Bulgaria' once again - with communist symbols and imagery already disappearing from flags, buildings, and documents. Additionally Mladenov and the more liberal-minded in the party hope to dissolve the BCP altogether, refounding it as the long disbanded 'Bulgarian Socialist Party' - with a now social democratic platform to replace the old Marxist-Leninist ideology.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022945;With the end of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, a Constitutional Assembly has been called to decide the future of the nation. While numerous political parties have emerged to run in said elections, two dominant forces have risen above the rest as they lay out their vision for a western oriented Bulgarian state. The BSP, the reformed Communist Party, wishes to move away from the socialist past gradually while the Union of Democratic forces desires a rapid transition towards capitalism and a western style democracy. However, its likely that regardless of the winner, compromise and pressure from the public and the international community will play a substantial role in the shape of the new state.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022946;Bulgaria's fourth constitution is set to soon be drafted and come into effect. Despite the composition of the national assembly, the draft proposed remained a compromise between the various forces that had won some number of seats in the election. The constitution is set to call for the creation of a parliamentary system with a basic separation of powers based on those in many western states. Additionally, this new constitution will enshrine multiple values wished for by opposition forces - namely regarding the recognition of the country's language and religion, its sovereignty, and several aspects of what is regarded as its culture.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022947;As per the new constitution recently put into force, elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year. Already two parties have emerged to dominate the new political landscape of the nation - the Bulgarian Socialist Party, reformed from the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the 'Union of Democratic Forces that has formed as a coalition of opposition and conservative forces in the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022948;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year. Like most elections in the nation's recent history, they are primarily set to be dominated by a battle between social democratic and conservative forces. These elections in particular see the BSP dominated Democratic Left Coalition facing up against the conservative United Democratic Forces.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022949;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year.

EVTDESC8022950;'Ostalgia', or 'Ostalgie' - made up from the German words 'Ost' and 'Nostalgie' - describes a phenomena in the post-communist states that encompasses a wide rage of favorable outlooks on the previous communist regimes in those nations. While taking different forms in different places, having different motivations, and being both manipulated by and viewed in different lights by various political groups and portions of the population - its effect on the mindset and culture of the nations and peoples that experience it is hard to ignore. Across much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc the so-called 'Ostalgia' would go on to inspire voting patterns, art, culture, and even the rise of new organizations and ideologies. \n\n In Bulgaria, feelings of ostalgia would persist well into the modern day as the nation's economy deteriorated in the wake of the end of communism in the nation. Many of the people that had grown up earning a technical education or other specialized background now found themselves without a livelihood, and political instability - as well as integration into organizations like the EU and NATO - would only further cement these feelings as time passed among large portions of the population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022951;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year. Like most elections in the nation's recent history, they are primarily set to be dominated by a battle between social democratic and conservative forces. These elections in particular see the BSP dominated Democratic Left Coalition facing up against the conservative United Democratic Forces that opposed it alongside the newly formed populist-liberal 'National Movement for Stability and Progress'.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022952;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year.

EVTDESC8022953;While the presence of coal within Stara Zagora had been known for much of the 1800s, it wouldn't be until the 1950s that the nation would finally make use of its natural wealth. With aid from the government, it would go on to produce much of the nation's coal - supplying the fuel of new power plants built across the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022954;The discovery of natural gas in Pleven means the potential for Bulgaria to join the numerous nations with their own reserves. While it will likely take a sizable initial investment, its likely to pay off quickly and enable economic growth in the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022955;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year. Like most elections in the nation's recent history, they are primarily set to be dominated by a battle between social democratic and conservative forces. These elections in particular see the BSP dominated Democratic Left Coalition facing up against the conservative GERB and its minor allied parties. \n\n The &Year& elections, saw the 'National Movement for Stability and Progress'/National Movement Simeon II, that had emerged as a liberal-populist force in recent elections - fall to the wayside as it was surpassed by the new conservative GERB party, ultimately ousting it from politics entirely as its support and popularity began to dwindle.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022956;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year. Like most elections in the nation's recent history, they are primarily set to be dominated by a battle between social democratic and conservative forces. These elections in particular see the BSP dominated Democratic Left Coalition facing up against the conservative GERB and its minor allied parties. \n\n The &Year& elections, having partially been influenced by protests, have been so far riddled with minor scandal. Voter apathy, accusations of corruption, and general dissatisfaction with the political climate in the country that only worsened as the revelation that illegal campaign ballots were distributed.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022957;Elections are set to be held in Bulgaria this year.

EVTDESC81229100;Chervenkov, the unquestioned leader of Bulgaria for decades now, has today passed away. In his wake, the efforts that he put into place to build support for his - still small - Stalinist faction have begun to bear fruit. While the nation mourns and preparations for a funeral commence, talks within the party have begun on who should replace Chervenkov as leader of Bulgaria, and if the ideology of Stalinism should continue to lead the country into the future. \n\n The two most prominent choices currently are that of Todorov-Gorunya - a self-professed Stalinist heavily inspired by Chinese Maoism - and Dragoycheva whose support for the Soviet line and more hardline policies has earned her the parties' approval as a potential force to carry on the late leader's legacy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229101;With the 'Home Communist' faction now finally achieving for itself some manner of power in the nation there have been talks to reassess the BCP's party line and overall platform. Up until now, Bulgaria's policies have closely mirrored that of those in the Soviet Union and other WTO nations with only minor deviation as the need arose or politics within the government shifted in favor of change - however, the 'Home Communists' wish a more independent and distinctly 'Bulgarian' approach towards building communism in the nation. Many of them hope to push for a replication of the 'Market Socialism' followed in Yugoslavia under Tito, as well as greater cooperation and trade to help further stimulate the economy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229102;Anton Yugov has announced today his intentions to step away from political life - effectively retiring from his posts, a move driven on by the internal conflicts within the party and his own declining health. In his wake moves have already been made to seek a successor - with the most prominent voices coming from the more hardline factions, seeking a restoration of ties with the USSR and more orthodox views of communism being enacted in the nation. However, the reformists have also made moves to propel themselves into power, with Mladenov praising many of Yugov's policies - calling for a continuation of reforms within Bulgaria and for the nation to forge its own path towards communism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229103;Seeking even more radical change in the country and its structures than merely reforms to its economic system, Kostov today has put forward the draft to a sweeping constitutional change that would see Bulgaria reshaped in what Kostov himself calls a more 'Bulgarian' image. The new constitution is set to provide a departure from the previous Soviet inspired constitution, primarily focusing on removing the more overt imitation of Soviet structures and the reestablishing of several previously abolished administrative divisions - as well as the creation of entirely new systems to replace the old. The draft also includes mentions of Bulgaria's position in the Balkans, emphasizing cooperation and friendship with Yugoslavia - something that had been discouraged by the USSR in the wake of the split between Tito and Stalin.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229104;Bulgaria has long been in the Soviet shadow, with its internal politics and policies at times being influenced by the de facto leader of the WTO. While many within the party are content with that state of affairs, seeing the Soviet Union's presence in Bulgaria as a stabilizing force, many of the more radical and nationalist leaning 'Home Communists' see it as something worth rectifying. Kostov and his allies have made the proposal to officially begin the move towards independence. \n\n While such a move isn't unique or out of the question for the - technically equal - members of the WTO, the USSR even still might perceive Bulgaria's moves as a threat to the communist bloc, or its own influence within Eastern Europe. However, given Bulgaria intends to remain part of the WTO it is unlikely to result in an invasion on its own, though the consequences of withdraw could embolden the opposition and prompt concerns in Moscow in Kostov's ability to lead the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229105;Bulgaria has formally petitioned us to remove troops from within their country and lesson influence over their domestic politics - moves that would remove much of the control the Soviet Union is currently able to exert on the nation. The Warsaw Treaty's principles mean such a move is well within Bulgaria's right, however even still some within the party's more hardline factions have expressed concerns over the possibility of leaving the nation. \n\n Instead these groups have raised fears that unrest could grow in the nation in the absence of Soviet troops, or of more liberal-minded elements within the party taking advantage of a lack of direct Soviet support for their own aims - claims that have been rebuffed by moderates and reformists who instead focus on stability within the Warsaw Pact as a whole over maintaining a tight grip on Europe.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229106;Bulgaria's attempt at independence has been put to an end today as Soviet troops instated Zhivkov and pro-Soviet moderates in the place of the now ousted 'Home Communists', with the new government already taking steps to secure its own stability.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229107;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229108;With Kostov's death, the end has come to a long period of 'Home Communist' dominance in Bulgarian politics. While its likely that the faction will remain in a position of authority within the BCP for decades to come, the decision remains inconclusive within the party as to which faction will come out on top of Bulgarian politics. Many would be content with moderates that will continue on the party line with little change, while others support either the reformists or hardliners - each with their own view of Bulgarian socialism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229109;Dragoycheva has always been a vocal supporter of Bulgarian integration into the USSR as a member republic, however until now her dream of leading the nation towards becoming the next Soviet Socialist Republic has been outweighed by a desire within the party to keep the nation firmly independent. With her and her allies at the helm this idea has now been propelled into the mainstream - with serious conversations now taking place within the party amid mounting tensions. Ultimately, however, any decision is contingent fully on the Soviet response - which has so far been one of caution about expanding its borders via Bulgarian integration.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229110;Bulgaria's leadership has formally petitioned to begin the process of becoming a Soviet Socialist Republic - a move that has been met with caution and surprise within the party. While many within the party would wholly accept the proposal - something that draws the USSR closer to the ideals of both Pan-Slavism and Eurasianism - many more have expressed concern that such a move could be viewed more negatively in the international community and remain skeptical of the support behind the idea within Bulgaria itself. However, ultimately the choice is ours as to whether to accept the proposal - with either possibility resulting in closer ties to our ally.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229111;The Soviet leadership have declined the prospect of integration, for now - having emphasized the unity between the Bulgarian and Soviet people in their rejection. Hopefully, they claim, one day the two peoples will be ready to become one. Until then, Bulgaria remains as an independent nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229112;Gorbachev's rise within the Soviet Union was met with uncertainty by the Dragoycheva administration despite its zealously pro-soviet attitude, a feeling only exacerbated by not only the materialization of these reforms within the USSR but by an increasing pressure on the member states of the WTO to enact reforms of their own mirroring that of the agenda of the Soviet reformists. \n\n Even with hardliners at the helm, Bulgaria has been unable to escape the bulk of that pressure. Dragoycheva has found herself personally approached by Soviet officials - with support from the BCP's own reformists - to make market reforms in the nation, many of which would be unlikely to draw the backing of more hardline elements within the party. Even still, failing to pass even a limited version of these reforms could prove problematic - with the Soviets possibly turning their support away from the government and towards the reformist wing of the party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229113;The ripples having been set out by Gorbachev's reforms in the USSR have finally reached Bulgaria. Demonstrations, strikes, and protests have been set ablaze across the nation calling for reforms and change. While most claim to only wish for changes within the framework of socialism, many other groups have arisen to join the movements that demand even more radical change - with their numbers growing with each passing day. Many within the party have proposed swift action while the movements remain relatively isolated, hoping to prevent violence against the regime as well as to ensure to continuation of a more orthodox line in the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229114;With Dragoycheva's passing, the nation is left to mourn its long-time leader while the varied factions of the party move to push for their own candidates to fill the now vacant office. While the most likely candidate is the more hardline Todorov-Gorunya, Lilov - a moderate - and Mladenov - a reformer - have been vocal in courting members of the party and public. In any case, its likely that whoever comes to lead Bulgaria will set the agenda and line of the party moving forward - bringing the nation into the future.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229115;Inspired by Maoist thought, Todorov-Gorunya has made moves to start a sweeping campaign across the nation modeled off of the theory and experiences of the Chinese leader. Dubbing it as a 'Cultural Revolution' after the campaign that inspired it, he hopes to achieve the same effect in Bulgaria of moving the country closer to a revolutionary mindset - as well as purging remaining elements of reaction. While some more moderate voices in the party have expressed concern over the move, the unease has been somewhat sated by the smaller scale of the project and changes based on China's own experiences.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229116;Todorov-Gorunya has announced his retirement from Bulgarian politics today, his advancing age seeing him increasingly drawing from public life. While its unlikely the stalwart Stalinists grip on power will decline until his passing - the party has already begun to discuss who should serve as a replacing. \n\n The main divide the party, now heavily populated by the outgoing leader's allies, is between those supporting a more moderate candidate and those supporting the continuation of hardline Stalinism in the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229117;The decision to appoint the scientist Elena Lagadinova to the high position she now enjoys, while controversial at the time among many within the party, has drawn the interest of an emerging faction within the ranks of the BCP. Lagadinova's presence in the government, they claim, has been an overall positive force - positive enough to replicate. Their efforts have already seen many fellow technical experts elevated to high positions in the party, however they are seemingly not content with their influence in the government. Instead, they hope to take advantage of the technocratic bend that Bulgarian society, and government, has taken to replace the currently General Secretary Zhivkov with their own Lagadinova - hoping to usher in a period of technocracy within the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229118;Uranium has been located within the Plovdiv province, a discovery that will enable Bulgaria to explore a host of options in regards to nuclear power and beyond. However, an initial investment from the government is needed in order to fund the initial work in getting to and extracting these resources safely.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229119;Lagadinova, citing declining age and a desire to step back from politics, has announced her intent to retire from her leadership position within Bulgaria. Instead, she has left the party to decide who will fill in the now vacant position. While years of technocratic dominance have ensured that there is a good chance that such policies continue on, reformists and hardliners have begun their own campaign to lobby support within the party - hoping to revive their power and push for less pragmatic technocracy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229120;The process of automation in Bulgaria carries on, with the small-scale experiments having proven to be massive successes. Preparations have already been made to begin carrying out similar changes and reforms all across the country - with a new generation of experts, programmers, and more ready to staff the newly created jobs while structural changes within the apparatuses of the Bulgarian government commence in earnest.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229121;With the advent of new technology, the possibility has arisen to take Bulgarian automation to an even higher stage. While the current system on its own is efficient, many have proposed creating a national network - allowing for even more instant communication between various factories and farms not only with planners but one another and the various automated systems that have enabled us to more accurately and efficiently steer the economy. All that would be needed is an initial investment into creating the infrastructure, as well updating existing systems.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229122;Mladenov and his fellow reformists have made no secret of their admiration for their ideological allies within the CPSU, especially the more vocal figures within the faction. The rise of these forces within the USSR has only emboldened this idolization further - with a heavy focus on the programs and policies now being enacted by Soviet leader Gorbachev. The sweeping and drastic changes, referred to as 'Glasnost' and 'Perestroika', have earned praise from Mladenov, who hopes to enact similar such changes within Bulgaria itself. While its likely such a move is, similar to in the USSR, upset more moderate or hardline elements within the party - its also likely to bring further backing from the Soviets, who will surely support their fellow reformists within the WTO.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229123;Changes are sweeping across the Warsaw Pact in the wake of the changes taking place in the Soviet Union, as well as a dwindling line of support to its allied states. While Bulgaria's situation itself is mostly stable, there are still growing calls to move towards a more western model for the nation - a move that Reformists have been receiving warmly so far. Mladenov himself has already drafted a new Bulgarian constitution - calling on the restoration of elements of western democracy in the nation and a move away from the communist system that has dominated the country for decades.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229124;With the radical changes that have come to Bulgaria in the past few years, calls for further reforms to the structure and position of the party itself have begun to emerge from more liberal elements in society. Many are calling on the BCP to fully abandon Marxism-Leninism as a party line, something that is now seen as no longer applicable to the conditions within Bulgaria - instead urging the party to refound itself as a social democratic party, and importantly to give up its dominant position in politics.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229125;With his health in decline, Mladenov has announced his retirement from politics today - leaving his post vacant for the time being. As the party and National Assembly each take steps to fill and reshuffle positions in his new-found absence a question has been posed to the party on its future. While the most obvious choice would be to continue the reformist line set by Mladenov and his allies, there still remains within the BCP a hardline tendency - with many eager to see many of the more unpopular market reforms reversed entirely. Either choice is likely to determine Bulgaria's course for several years to come.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229126;With hardliners in the party - Stalinists, Maoists, and Orthodox Marxist-Leninists - allowed to continue to grow and gain influence within not only the party, but the government and society as well, it was only a matter of time before they made moves to further their agenda. Two prominent members have already risen up as potential replacements for Zhivkov - who now faces an ouster from his former posts. Dragoycheva, a hardliner whose pro-Soviet stance makes her an excellent pick for closer relations with the USSR and continued stability in the nation, and Todorov-Gorunya, whose blend of Stalinism and Maoist thought could bring more radical change to the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229127;With the party's reformist wing steadily gaining influence and support within both the government, party, and greater Bulgarian society - it was only a matter of time before it made moves to undermine the authority of its rival factions. Mladenov, the leader of the reformists, has formally announced his intentions to challenge Zhivkov's position - now having enough backing to follow through. Even still, its likely hardliners and moderates alike will unite together in the wake of what they are already calling a 'party coup' - eagerly waiting for a chance to steer the nation away from whatever direction the reformists might guide it towards.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229128;With Zhivkov's advancing age, the Bulgarian leader today has announced he is stepping down from his position of power within the government and party. In his wake the BCP has already begun the process of electing his successor, with the choice tied between Lilov and Paunov - both moderate candidates who show promise in ensuring continued stability within the socialist state.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229129;The rumblings of unrest have started to rise to the surface within Romania, with various factions of the party beginning to take issue more vocally with the mismanagement of the Ceausescu regime. Recently several vocal dissidents within the party issued a letter - called the 'Letter of the Six' - calling on a resignation of the Romanian leader. Chief among these voices is, Apostol, a self-described 'Reformist-Stalinist' who seeks to guide the nation back towards a more orthodox path. \n\n Given that our position is relatively stable, we are presented with the opportunity to potentially help nudge the course of events in our allied state. A few within the party have put forward an idea to help oust Ceausescu, putting Apostol and other dissidents in his place within the party - a move that, while drastic, would surely set the nation on a more ideologically sound course. However, others within the party have pointed out that Romania's reformists could also prove to be a viable choice - hoping to court support for their own allies abroad in any potential intervention.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229130;The Soviet withdraw from Afghanistan means a potential defeat for the Communist regime in the country - having already been forced to make numerous concessions in attempts to reach an end to the bloody conflict against the Mujahideen. However, some within the party have proposed that - given our own country's situation - we could spare resources to aid the regime in hopes that it might prove enough to ensure victory for the regime. Such a move, however, would likely draw the ire of the international community.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81229131;Zhivkov's actions in starting a mass campaign of assimilation within the nation has slowly drawn an increasing disdain for his rule - not only from the Muslim and Turkish communities within Bulgaria - but from reformists who have already been vocal in their dissatisfaction with the Bulgarian leader's efforts to embrace their proposed agenda. Without intervention, its likely that the situation will boil over into an eventual confrontation between this increasingly powerful faction and Zhivkov's own administration. However, we are currently in a position to tip the scales - decisive support for Zhivkov could be enough to ensure the leader remains in his office, though our own reformists think it would be wise to help push for Zhivkov's resignation instead.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8211026;Leonid Kupriyanovich, a prominent Soviet engineer already well-known for his work on creating more portable versions of various communication devices throughout the 50s, has recently come to the government with a rather unique innovation that is sure to bring radical chance to the field - being among the first of its kind in the world. He claims to have created a mobile version of the phone, showing off prototypes for a device that is small enough to fit in the palm of the hand. Already plans have been made for the mass production of this device and its further improvement and specialization, not only for various fields such as the medical and military professions, but for the general public as well - including the creation of a network for these devices around Moscow and other larger cities.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8017677;Following strong pressures from Moscow, Babrak Kamal was forced to resign his position as General Secretary of the PDPA on the 4th of May 1986 at the 18th Plenum of the Party. The Congress unanimously elected Mohammed Najibullah as its General Secretary. Najibullah, an ethnic Pashtun, has until then held the office of Minister of National Security and longtime leader of the Secret Police (KHAD). Najibullah in his speech announced a Collective Leadership consisting of himself, Karmal as Head of State and Sultan Ali Keshtmand as Secretary of the Council of Ministers.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017678;Since the establishment of the Collective Leadership tensions within the party have been sour. Former Chairman Karmal has been hampering Najibullah's attempts at establishing a National Reconciliation Committee and many on the reformist wing of the Party fear he may be able to use return as Lead of the party. Letters from the Kremlin suggest that we should remove Karmal from his position of Head of State and exile him to the USSR, but will that work out?;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017679;With Karmal back in power and the expulsion of Najibullah from the Collective Leadership the power of the Conservative Parcham Faction is not yet consolidated, as former head of the Secret Services, Najibullah, holds many connections with their ranks and the leadership, and those same people helped his power-grab attempt.

EVTDESC8017680;Following strong pressures from Moscow, Babrak Kamal was forced to resign his position as General Secretary of the PDPA on the 4th of May 1986 at the 18th Plenum of the Party. The Congress unanimously elected Assadullah Sarwari as its General Secretary. Sarwari gained first prominence among the party ranks for his involvement with the Gang of Four under the Amin regime, constituting one of the most prominent hardline opposition to the short-lived government, besides having headed the KHAD's predecessor ASGA.

EVTDESC8017684;With the ousting of Karmal and the Parchamite Government, the Khalqists headed by the General-Secretary have been wishing to avenge the suppression received under the last governance and the first step towards this is to expurgate the institution from Parcham elements and restore the symbols, starting from the Coat of Arms and the Flag.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8017687;The Central Committee has long been discussing the resignation of Afghanistan's PDPA Babrak Karmal due to the budget drain he has been inflicting on our national coffers. In the last few years the Leader of the DRA hasn't managed to make any significant progress in his fight for national consolidation nor to end the war, while the USSR's public opinion was smeared internationally and the army overextended. Now that Karmal is conducting a State Visit in Moscow it seems like it could be the right time to confront him about resignation and allow for a better suited Chairman to take over the Party and hopefully end the war on his favour.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001403;With the dissolution of the USSR the Socialist Camp faces its most tumultuous time yet as shocking news sends powerful ripples across Eastern Europe - the cracks already starting to form as governments brace for the worst. Its likely that such a massive change to the political landscape of not only Europe, but the world at large, will spell disaster for many regimes. Even within our own nation forces have started to muster, hoping to take advantage of the chaos that might ensue and use the unfolding situation to fulfill their own goals.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001404;With the chaotic situation in the country both economically and politically, murmurs within the parties more fringe factions have started to buzz ever louder. Chief among these are the so-called 'Reformists', supporters of market reforms, democratization, liberalization, and even closer ties with the West. While in better times such forces could easily be dismissed - the current situation is far from ideal. \n\n Already several prominent members of these groups have approached the leadership with an ultimatum, that being to cede power to them or face a number of threats ranging from vague unrest to outright civil war. While many hardliners are sure to resent what is an apparent coup against the regime from within, it might be best to give into the more moderate demands rather than risk even further destabilization.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001405;With Reformists now firmly within a position of power and the situation still declining, a proposal for a sweeping liberalization both politically and economically has been put forward. This includes extended recognition of private ownership, the reorganization of opposition parties, lessoning the power and authority of the communist party, and opening the country's foreign policy towards its former enemies in the west. While its likely that these changes could help stop the rapid changes sweeping across the nation, it would serve as another step away from socialism and towards a more western-style of governance and economics.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001406;Amid the perceived collapse of Marxism-Leninism an unthinkable proposition has been put forward as part of the continued changes sweeping the nation - and the larger Socialist Camp at large. The more radical reformists have put forward the idea of completely abandoning the party's platform entirely, washing away Marxism-Leninism and instead embracing what they claim is a more pragmatic ideology of social democracy. Such a move would almost certainly spell the end of the current, shaky, status quo - though few remain to oppose the reformists as they continue the charge away from the East.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001407;The reforms made by the more liberal-minded within the communist party have reached the conclusion many feared from the start. Opposition parties, organized under a broad banner of neoliberalism and integration into the global economic system set up by the west, are using the newfound changes to the country's laws and constitution to continue where the reformists have left off. Already protests have erupted across the nation, packed with supporters for these new organizations as they demand for the complete democratization of the nation and free elections - as well as guaranteed representation in any new government that might form in the future.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9001408;With Reformists already making up a sizable force within our nation, we have averted the fate of many of the more hardline regimes as they deal with attempted party coups and unrest among the varied factions within them. Instead, those same forces within our nation have put forward similar demands in a much more constructive manner - citing the declining situation and the dwindling number of paths forward as evidence of the necessity of the bold changes they suggest. Even still, the more stable situation affords us a greater opportunity to attempt to weather the storm currently facing the Socialist Camp, with more hardline elements already making preparations to do whatever it takes to stay the course.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940014;Since the start of 1945 there has been an uneasy truce between the communist partisans that helped to liberate Greece from the clutches of fascism and the monarchist government that has found backing from the British and the rest of the Allied forces.

While the treaty promised the communist forces amnesty, retained the legality of the KKE, and offered a referendum on the status of Greece's monarchy - a reign of 'White Terror' followed not long after that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of former partisans and the arrest of many thousand more, effectively nullifying many of the treaty's promises.

With the Cold War now on the horizon and communist governments consolidating themselves across Eastern Europe, many within Greece see the prospects of peace dwindling even further. \n\n Initially, thanks in part to the backing from the Allied forces that helped to liberate Greece and secure its legitimate government to power - as well as the seeming military defeat of the communist forces in the country, it was believed that the country would see an end of the troubles that had threatened to tear it apart during the waning days of the Second World War. However, as the situation in the world changes so does the Greece's own. Civil War is once again a threat to the nation, with only time serving to tell if the tenuous peace will continue to hold.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940017;Elections are scheduled to be held in the wider Greece in March, with the fate of the elections likely to play a strong factor in the promised referendum on the monarchy scheduled for later in the year. This would be an opportunity to, alongside our former allies in the EAM, to stand for election as part of a broad left coalition and potentially make good on our previous goal of working towards the establishment of a 'People's Democracy' in the nation. However, such a prospect is not one that the leadership of the KKE has expressed little interest or optimism within. \n\n In the wake of the campaigns of white terror, mostly unchecked by the Greek State, the most hardline members of the party are adamant that any election - or referendum - conducted by the Greek state would be fraudulent, in favor of the monarchist parties. Instead, calls to push for the complete liberation of Greece continue to grow louder within the ranks of the KKE - with many more emboldened as the confrontation between the USSR and USA slowly begins to flare.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940018;The KKE has announced its sudden intentions to boycott the upcoming elections scheduled for March. While such a move was not entirely unexpected given the tumultuous situation in the north of the country - it does serve to further drive a rift in the peace process, effectively killing any hope for a peaceful resolution between the conflict between the former partisan forces and the Greek government. Many within the military are already preparing for any potential action, with efforts to continue the disarmament of the ex-partisans redoubled as the cloud of civil war looms once more.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940019;The KKE has, in a surprising move given the previous direction of its rhetoric, restated its commitment to participating in the upcoming Greek elections. While this bodes well for the fate of the Treaty between the Greek government and the former partisan forces - many express concerns of their own. Win, or loss, the KKE would feel itself emboldened by support within our own government and among the population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940020;With the situation in Greece as tense as it has been in over a year, the kindling has been laid out to be set aflame into yet another Civil War. Former partisans, angered by the actions of the Greek government and bitter over their efforts to bring liberation to the country boring a foreign backed regime aligned with the forces of reaction, have already started to collect arms and ammunition from stockpiles hidden after the treaty was signed - with many more already preparing actions of their own. \n\n Given the circumstances within the nation, and the world, the treaty seems set to fall apart without intervention from the KKE's leadership - who up to now have reiterated the desire to push for a military solution to the issue of Greece's fate.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940021;Today, ahead of the elections scheduled for the March 31, a group of communist partisans - operating under the authority of the KKE's central leadership - attacked a police station in Litochoro. While the attack itself killed 14 people who were at the station at the time, it also has served to set in motion what many in the government had feared up until this point - a resumption of hostilities with the communist forces. Already groups across the north are rearming, with their strongholds casting off government control as Greece enters the third - and hopefully final - phase of its civil war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940022;The conflict between Tito and Stalin has finally reached a breaking point - with the two nations publicly announcing a break in relations with one another. For Greece, like the rest of the Balkans, this means a choice between adhering to the Soviet line or aligning fully with Yugoslavia. While, on the surface, such a choice seems simple given Tito's vocal and active support for the Greek communist partisans - many within the KKE's leadership hold sympathies to the Soviet model of communism, or in the case of the general secretary, Zachariadis, an adherence to Stalinist doctrine. \n\n Even still, there are many within the KKE and the wider communist movement that support Yugoslavia, and even outright declare themselves to be 'Titoists' - including the head of the provisional government, Vafeiadis. As the party's representatives gather to hold a vote on the official line of the KKE, its likely both factions and their respective heads will end up coming to conflict - an event likely to change the course of Greece should it attain its liberation, as well as effect the manner in which the civil war must be conducted.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940023;With the KKE's decision to side with the Soviets in the Tito-Stalin split, the party has been thrown into a state of chaos. Hundreds of members have been expelled on accusations of Titoism, with many more quitting outright - with splits forming in the larger partisan movement based around the decision. While in the long term this could mean a more united party, in the short term it will likely greatly impede the ability to wage war against the capitalists, as well as hold the already disparate provisional government together.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940024;Not all partisans remained in Greece following the end of hostilities outlined in the Treaty of Varkiza. Many, seeking to avoid any potential actions by the reactionary government, had fled to nations across Eastern Europe - with weapons and family in tow. Now, with civil war erupting in Greece once more, many of these brave fighters have returned to offer their assistance - hoping to finally reclaim their home from the British puppets.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940025;The General Command has issued an order proclaiming that all partisan groups be unified under a single banner - that being of the newly created Democratic Army of Greece. Vafeiadis, a leading figure of the among the communist forces and already in a leadership position among the partisan groups, is set to assume leadership over the forces. Its hoped that by reorganizing the disparate partisan groups around the country, a more effective fighting force can be created to fight in the struggle for liberation and people's democracy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940026;The KKE, together with the newly proclaimed Democratic Army of Greece, have today announced the creation of the Provisional Government of Greece - a more coherent and structured governing body for the budding socialist state emerging across the north of the country. The move, part of a larger strategy of increasing the legitimacy of the communist forces both domestically and internationally, has already started to bare fruit as the new government presents itself as the liberators of Greece, evoking the resistance during the Second World War - of which many members of new government were involved prior to joining the communist cause after the conclusion of the war and first stages of conflict.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940027;Across the north of Greece there are many Slavic peoples - notably Bulgarians and Macedonians - have taken up arms together with Greeks against their capitalist oppressors. These groups, long pushed to the fringe by the Kingdom of Greece and its predecessors, now have a shot at liberation. As such, the Provisional Government has announced a decision that, after the conclusion of the Civil War, both groups are to be given equal status within the new nation. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940028;Military aid and equipment have arrived today from Bulgaria - with the communist government there voicing its support for our cause. Already we've begun putting the equipment, mostly leftover from the Second World War, to use in supplying our partisans. This will surely go a long way not only to embolden our movement, but further cement our relations with the emerging socialist bloc.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940029;In a bold show of support, Bulgarian soldiers today have moved across the border into southern Macedonia and Thrace - securing positions in the name of the provisional communist government and driving out paramilitary groups supported by the West and their allies in Athens. While such a daring move is likely to put the west on edge and further isolate Bulgaria, it has only deepened support between our two nations as both peoples work towards revolution. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940030;Military aid and equipment have arrived today from Albania - with the communist government there voicing its support for our cause. Already we've begun putting the equipment, mostly leftover from the Second World War, to use in supplying our partisans. This will surely go a long way not only to embolden our movement, but further cement our relations with the emerging socialist bloc.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940031;In a bold show of support, Albanian soldiers today have moved across the border into Epirus - securing positions in the name of the provisional communist government and driving out paramilitary groups supported by the West and their allies in Athens. While such a daring move is likely to put the west on edge and further isolate the new Albanian state, it has only deepened support between our two nations as both peoples work towards revolution. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940032;Long having provided us arms and aid, Yugoslavia has yet again reaffirmed its support for our cause. Long vocal support has grown even more as equipment, mainly leftover from the Second World War, has flowed with increasing frequency across the border. Already the equipment is being put to use in arming partisans, solidifying the friendship between the Yugoslav and Greek peoples.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940033;In a bold and daring show of their commitment to revolution in Greece, Yugoslavia has announced it will be deploying troops in Southern Macedonia to help secure the region for the provisional communist government - helping to maintain order as well as drive out western-backed paramilitary groups operating in the region. While such a move is likely to heavily isolate Yugoslavia from the West, it has only deepened support between our two nations, both peoples working towards the common goal of liberation and revolution across the Balkans.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940034;Distancing from his former policy on the question of revolution in Greece, Stalin today has announced today that the Soviet government will be providing arms and aid to the Greek partisans. Already the Soviet equipment - more advanced than the outdated leftovers from the Second World War - has been put to use in equipping our forces. Additionally advisors and economic aid from the Soviets has also reached us, further emboldening the partisans - as well as strengthening the position of the pro-Moscow elements of the KKE.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940035;The Democratic Army of Greece, operating together with partisan groups working within the areas controlled by the western supported Greek government, have made a stunning push into Attica. This move has effectively put the lands under our nominal control - though effective government has yet to be established and already the forces of reaction have begun to launch their own counterattack. Many within the provisional government think it would be wise to direct our efforts to hold these territories until we can establish more effective governance - hoping to use a victory over Attica to mount a final push towards Athens proper. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940036;Partisan groups aligned with the communist rebels have worked together with communist forces to mount a push into Attica - effectively wrestling control of the region from the legitimate authorities there. While this marks a massive setback for the Hellenic Army, many remain confident that we can turn the tide - though they emphasize that we should act quickly lest the communists be bolstered by their victory in the region.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940037;Effective control over the territories of Attica has been secured - and with it the manpower and resources put at our disposal. The establishment of effective control over these areas is likely to be a massive boon to our own forces while serving to further drive the capitalists from Greece.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940038;Another loss for the legitimate government of Greece has come today as the communists have managed to secure the lands in Attica they had previously occupied - effectively making these provinces part of their 'provisional government'. While this marks a massive setback to Greece, the Hellenic Army continues its struggle for unity and peace.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940039;Partisan forces within Corinthia have risen up in the midst of the Civil War, managing to secure parts of the region for the Provisional government - and working to drive out the reactionaries from their homes. Already the people welcome their liberation from the oppressive British backed government, with fighters filling our ranks as the provisional government moves to integrate them into the larger Democratic Army of Greece.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940040;Across Corinthia rebels are rising to the call made by the communist provisional government, with most of the fighting taking place in the northern reaches of the region. While they have successfully managed to oust local authorities from most of the smaller towns - the Hellenic Army and police forces have already begun making preparations for a counter-offensive, hoping to rob the communists of their short-lived victory and reassert their authority.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940041;The Situation on Crete had long differed from that on the mainland. While the ELAS had been dissolved and disarmed in larger Greece - due to the unique situation that had unfolded on the island the ELAS remained armed and active. However, even still - it had mostly honored the tenuous peace established by the Treaty of Varkiza, an uneasy truce established with local authorities on the island. This truce lasted even after the resumption of hostilities on the mainland, with the still armed and active branch of ELAS largely isolated of the larger struggles taking place across Greece. \n\n That has isolation, as well as the peace, have seemingly been broken however. Operating on orders from the mainland, the Cretan authorities have made a series of arrests across the island - provoking an armed response from the island's communist forces as they join the fight for liberation once more, pledging their support to the provisional government and launching a full scale insurgency to take control of Crete.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940042;The Situation on Crete had long differed from that on the mainland. While the ELAS had been dissolved and disarmed in larger Greece - due to the unique situation that had unfolded on the island the ELAS remained armed and active. However, even still - it had mostly honored the tenuous peace established by the Treaty of Varkiza, an uneasy truce established with local authorities on the island. This truce lasted even after the resumption of hostilities on the mainland, with the still armed and active branch of ELAS largely isolated of the larger struggles taking place across Greece. \n\n That isolation has seemingly been broken. Acting on orders from Athens, local authorities have moved to attempt to preempt any insurgency on the island - succeeding only in provoking the still armed partisans on the island into a full scale insurgency. Already the local remnants of the ELAS have pledged themselves to the newly formed Democratic Army of Greece, taking up positions on the island and threatening to rob Greece of control over yet more of its territory.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940043;Resigning to its fate, the British backed government of traitors in Athens has chosen to flee the country entirely. Thousands of supporters of the regime, as well as its major officials and ruling organs, have already made a hasty retreat in the wake of the advances of our partisan forces - leaving the people of Greece to chaos and uncertainty as they await liberation and a swift restoration of order under the provisional government. Instead the former officials and authorities have made their way to Cyprus, reviving a Second World War era plan to setup a 'government in exile' on the island. \n\n Already, the government there has started to take shape and organize - taking the reigns from the local colonial authorities, presenting itself as 'liberators' of the Cypriot Greeks, and reasserting its 'legitimacy' as the sole government of Greece. While challenging their claim in Cyprus is currently an impossibility given the status of the nation - there is no doubt among the people of Greece that the Provisional government is the legitimate governing body, with much of the socialist world taking our side as one by one they recognize our government over that of the now 'exiled' one in Cyprus.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940044;With the last remnants of the Greek government on the retreat, the time has finally come to proclaim our victory in the Civil War. While Greece has been ravaged by this conflict, from the ashes liberation and prosperity will come. Already the framework of a new Greek state has begun to emerge, with spontaneous organizations popping up across the country as partisan groups return to their normal life - celebrating a victory for socialism that will ring across Europe.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8940045;While the Provisional Government, headed by the leadership of the KKE, acted as the de facto authority in the Communist held areas of Greece during a majority of the Civil War - this informal and inefficient structure has finally outlived its usefulness. Instead, the time has come to write a new constitution for Greece that will serve as a foundation for a true People's Democracy. Given the Marxist-Leninist leanings of the KKE, and their prominence within the partisan movement, it only seems natural that a majority of those that now find themselves in a position of power seek to emulate the emerging states across Eastern Europe - notably Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. However, some instead have proposed an alternative - a revival of the old EAM and a multi-party system that incorporates a broad front of leftist parties and organizations.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941014;In the wake of the Second World War, conflict quickly arose in Greece between the partisans - a loose coalition of far-left parties, organizations, and militia groups - and the Greek government in exile and its legitimate authorities backed by the British. While the confrontation was short-lived, its scars have continued to linger on. Across the North of the country local governments, pro-government militia groups, and mobs of disgruntled citizens riled up by returning officials have been conducting campaigns targeting Leftist forces - primarily those that fought in the partisan groups, though also including even those still loyal to our regime. \n\n While this has, thus far, largely been ignored by the central government in Athens - arrests involving several of those promised amnesty, tortures, and murders have provoked an increasingly vocal and aggressive response from the Communist forces. With the world order in Europe quickly taking shape, some within the government feel the time might have come for the government to step in, if only for pragmatism's sake to stop some of the worst offenders of the continued unrest.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941015;Across the North of Greece our comrades currently face harassment, threats, arrests, and even outright murder at the hands of rabid paramilitary organizations and local governments looking to reassert their authority over the formerly rebellious lands. While this treatment has been nothing new since Greece's liberation from Axis occupation, its likely to further fan the flames of a possible resumption of hostilities as members of the KKE and former partisan organizations turn further away from the prospects for a peaceful solution to mending the scar in Greek society.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941016;Greece's upcoming elections are set to be some of the most important in the country's recent history. According to the agreement reached in the Treaty of Varkiza a referendum on the monarchy is set to be held later in the year, and it is likely to be heavily influenced by the ruling party at the time as well as public opinion towards the government. \n\n While currently liberal republican parties hold nominal sway over the government - their power in part carried over from the exiled administration - monarchist parties have rallied their support and stepped up their efforts to spread propaganda. There is also the matter of leftist parties in the country - legally allowed to continue their operation under the same treaty that ended the conflict. While lingering unrest and instability have cast doubts on their commitment to electoralism - they hold enough sway within the nation to potentially swing the vote with only a few months away.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941017;Elections have come upon Greece, with each of the parties involved hoping for a victory in what is set to be a contentious and heavily partisan vote. While the ruling Liberal Party - with its republican sympathies - hopes to retain some level of power in whatever new government takes shape, monarchist parties have redoubled their effort to focus on the preservation of Greece's Kingdom. Whatever the outcome, its likely that the results will be a precursor to the planned referendum later in the year - with the ruling party likely upping its efforts to push for its own desired outcome.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941018;As per the Treaty of Varkiza, the people are set to vote today in a referendum to decide the countries' future. The vote will determine whether Greece's monarchy will remain or whether a new republic will replace it. While thus far Greece's monarchy has survived decades of political unrest, instability, conquest, war, and occupation - it has been increasingly tested as Greece modernizes and the world around it changes. Even still, monarchist forces remain confident that the people will side with them - heavily playing to ideas of Greek patriotism and the stability they claim a monarchy can bring, hoping to counter the propaganda of left and Republican parties with their own slogans and posters.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941019;In an unsurprising result, the referendum held today in Greece has seen the monarchy preserved. Already protests and minor scuffles have arisen - with calls that the referendum was rigged and invalid permeating the republican opposition. For our own part, the result has only emboldened our hardline supporters - solidifying the necessity for revolution and the impossibility of reform so long as the British and their client kingdom reign in Greece's affairs.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941020;In a massive shock not only to Greece, but to the KKE as well, the referendum held today in Greece has seen the monarchy overwhelmingly voted out of its decades' long place in Greek politics. While the pro-monarchist forces already have set about protesting the result, the republicans have rejoiced together with the left - renewed hopes for a united republic shining a light into Greece's uncertain future.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941021;Operation Torch is set to be a grand counter-offensive against the forces of the DSE - aimed primarily at striking their strongholds north of Attica. The plan, proposed in the wake of a slow retreat of communist forces, aims to put a swift end of the civil war and break the enemies' ability to continue to be on the offensive anywhere in the nation. Already preparations have been made alongside British advisors and aid, with the only thing remaining being an official government order to carry it out.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941022;Seeking to further their efforts to aid the legitimate government of Greece, the British have sent additional aid to the country in the form of military equipment and funds. Already the generosity of the United Kingdom is being put to good use in bolstering our war effort against the communists - with outdated arms being replaced with the more advanced models provided by the British.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941023;Spurred on by the emerging ideological conflict with the Communist World, the Americans have decided to involve themselves in the fight for control over Greece. Currently they have provided the government with some of their surplus equipment and some minor funding to help keep the army running smoothly. Already the efforts are paying off for Greece, with the unexpected help not only providing much needed supplies but a boost to morale.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941024;PLACEHOLDER;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941025;Greece today has approached us with a request echoing one given from their kingdom to ours during the Second World War - permission to base themselves out of Cyprus as they flee the mainland and its surrounding islands. This comes as they lose more and more ground to the communist forces of the Democratic Army of Greece, with rebels already having taken much of the nation aside from a holdouts and popular support for the legitimate Greek government starting to wane throughout the nation. Such a request had previously been denied before on grounds that it would undermine British authority on the island - as well as the viability of basing a temporary government of exile elsewhere. This time, however, the circumstances are vastly different. \n\n Cyprus, already having proven itself a headache for the Empire with actions against our authorities on the island, once again seems to be ready to set the stage for widespread unrest in favor of its independence and desired Enosis, or union, with Greece proper. Even with such an action increasingly looking like it is an impossibility as a united nation, many advisors are bracing for the worst - with stirrings of nationalist organization already reaching the local administration. Some have suggested it might be worth accepting Greece's offer this time - even if it all but assures an end to the British presence on the island. Not only would we be spared the cost of holding onto the island, but it would keep some degree of British influence on the Greek government in exile there.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941026;The British have accepted our proposal to rebase in Cyprus - with the colonial authorities there signaling that they are willing to cede authority and power to Greek administration as soon as the situation allows. The only thing left now is to evacuate the government and as many loyalists as we can find, a task made easier with British assistance as our brave soldiers hold the line to allow us time to flee the mainland in the face of the now inevitable fall to communism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941027;In a terrible turn, the British have refused our proposal to rebase in Cyprus - citing the brewing chaos on the island and the need for stability and order, as well as fears over the growing power of the Soviet Union. While they have reaffirmed they will provide shelter to any who flee the now inevitable victory of communist forces - this proves to be a massive blow to the government, and what little morale and coherence remains among the army. It seems that, for the time being, Greece is lost.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941028;Greece has yet to recover from the dark days of occupation by the Axis forces during the Second World War, remaining a divided and broken nation on the verge of the abyss. However, the time has come to finally bring this broken and battered nation into a changing world. We have upheld all stipulations put forward by the Treaty of Varkiza that ended the bloody conflict with the communist partisans, now all that remains is to finally put to rest the last remnants of opposition to a united Greek Kingdom. We have already prepared an ultimatum to the KKE, demanding they submit to the government in Athens with the promise that their party will remain legal and its leaders free.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941029;The Kingdom of Greece has demanded we officialize our disarmament by dissolving the remnants of our government and submitting to the authority of Athens. Such a move, given the wide-spread violations of the Treaty of Varkiza and the blatant interference from the British in the elections and referendum, is unlikely to be popular with our supporters across the nation - many of whom continue to face harassment, arrests, and even death at the hand of the monarcho-fascist tyrants. Instead, many within the KKE believe the time has finally come to prepare for a third, and final, phase to the civil war - aiming to bring liberation to Greece by force rather than by the ballot.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941030;The KKE have refused to submit to the authority of Athens, all but affirming their intentions to once more take up arms against the state. While the police and military have already been put on high alert - its unlikely much can be done to avoid the now inevitable war for the future of the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941031;The KKE have accepted our proposal for a united Greece - joining the fold once more and agreeing to keep their activities within the legal framework for the Greek legal system and constitution. Throughout the nation people rejoice at the decision, a massive sigh of relief washing over the loyal subjects of the king as peace and stability begin to emerge from the chaos.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941032;Since the end of the Second World War, one of the major grievances among the left wing forces within Greece has been that of the Monarchy. The communists, along with even many of the liberals, saw the institution as outdated, and oppressive - with some going so far as to point to the influence of the British in helping to prop up and preserve the power of the King. Such sentiments helped fuel a civil war in the country, and seemed to be on the path towards igniting the still smoldering kindling left in its wake. \n\n However, Greece prevailed as the people turned out and overwhelmingly voted to proclaim a republic in what will be sure to stand as one of the most important dates in Greek history. Leftist and liberal forces alike united to work towards the goal, despite their differences, and once more we must unite - though this time towards the creation of a stable and coherent Greek State. Even without the monarchy, many still have doubts - though the Treaty of Varkiza's stipulations have been followed, and the time has finally come to put an end to the division that threatens to hold the nation back.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941033;Greece's newly proclaimed republican has come today to the KKE with an offer for unity - hoping that the leadership of the communist party will be receptive to following through on the final steps towards peace. The party themselves remains divided, even still, however. While the opportunity to work with a government no longer tainted by the British-backed monarchy has won over many within the upper leadership of the KKE, many more remain unconvinced of the sincerity of this new republic - instead preferring to continue to push for a resumption of war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941034;In an unfortunate turn of events, the leadership of the KKE have voted against reunification with Greece - even under the common banner of a Republic. This decision all but assures a return of conflict, and the continued division of the country as fears of bloodshed once again wash over the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941035;Greece can stand united and triumphant under the banner of Republicanism, as today the KKE has voted to accept reunification - hoping to work within the framework of a republic to achieve their dreams of a 'People's Democracy' in the nation. Celebrations across Greece have already broken out among supporters of both sides, the future secured for the moment as we work to bring Greek into the new world.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941036;As per the Treaty of Varkiza, the people are set to vote today in a referendum to decide the countries' future. The vote will determine whether Greece's monarchy will remain or whether a new republic will replace it. While thus far Greece's monarchy has survived decades of political unrest, instability, conquest, war, and occupation - it has been increasingly tested as Greece modernizes and the world around it changes. With a coalition of left and far-left parties having swept to power in the elections, and the wave of pro-Republican propaganda that followed, little doubt surrounds the outcome of the referendum. Already initial polls show a clear majority in favor of abolishing the outdated Monarchy - plans for a new constitution already underway among members of Parliament.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941037;With the Monarchy gone and socialists in power, there remains virtually no point for continued conflict and division between the KKE and their partisan allies and the government. Already draft bills completely forgoing the stipulations of the Treaty of Varkiza in exchange for a more KKE favorable replacement have been floated, with hopes high that the two forces can come together as the coalition adds yet another member to its ranks. Even still, some more moderate elements of the left-coalition believe it would be wise to continue to follow the Treaty of Varkiza, hoping to avoid ceding too much power to the far left and keep Greece firmly neutral on the world stage.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941038;Greece's socialist government today has come to the leadership of the KKE with a surprising offer - a power-sharing arrangement in which the KKE would be guaranteed power over the direction of the country as the need for a new constitution arises. Given that we are practically being given power over Greece, the leadership of the KKE - irrespective of their own differences - has nearly unanimously approved of the offer as they prepare to relocate to Athens and begin working towards building a People's Democracy.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941039;With a nominal socialist state in the works, and the KKE having accepted the offer to rejoin the government in full, the time has come to declare an extraordinary set of elections to decide the ultimate fate of Greece. While the ruling left coalition would see the preservation of some semblance of the country's old order and its neutrality in Europe's affairs maintained, both the pro-Tito and pro-Soviet factions of the KKE wish to emulate their respective influences and use them as a model for a future Greek communist state.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941040;Tensions have finally flared to the point of conflict today as reports of fighting among partisan groups and government forces has reached both the leadership of the KKE and the government in Athens. As the shaky and uneasy peace established by the Treaty of Varkiza breaks, the nation once against descends into chaos and uncertainty - with partisan groups across the nation now taking up arms as the Hellenic army moves in to try to contain the situation and reassert Greek authority.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941041;Tensions have finally flared to the point of conflict today as reports of fighting among partisan groups and government forces has reached both the leadership of the KKE and the government in Athens.

EVTDESC8941042;With only a few small isolated holdouts of the self-proclaimed 'Provisional Democratic Government' remaining, and most of the north now firmly under the authority and control of Athens, we have finally declared victory in the Civil War that has devastated our nation. While troubles are likely to persist, with the political and military defeat of the KKE we can finally focus on rebuilding our nation and recovering from the brutality and bloodshed that it has faced over the past few years.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941043;Much like before the third, and final, phase of the Greek Civil War - armed paramilitaries and local governments have begun campaigns of reprisal among civilian populations thought to have helped the communist cause, as well as former members of the partisan movement and self-styled 'veterans' of the conflict itself. Arrests, intimidation, bans, and even murders have been reported, with even the army and police usually turning a blind eye to the activities as reports grow. Even many within the government in Athens seem reluctant to respond, seeing the actions as just, or even beneficial - though others believe it for the best that the government intervenes both to protect its own citizens and discourage vigilantism as well as to clear the path towards building trust and unity among the population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8941044;Once more the Cretan partisans have defied the fate of their mainland counterparts. While most of the island has fallen under the control of the Greek government - reports of holdouts, still armed and fighting for their 'People's Democracy', have reached Athens. While efforts are underway to route these remaining traitors out, for the time being it seems that the island will continue to face an insurgency that proves a thorn in any plans to fully recover and move out from the shadow of civil war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8022959;Despite the rapid and chaotic events sweeping across Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and the wider communist world, socialism continues to hold sway over millions of people. Many now reformed governments, more western in their orientation, continue to cling to old socialist systems - led by formerly communist and now more social-democratic leaning parties. With the Cold War all but over, we are in a position to tip the scales to ensure that these regimes have no chance to consolidate themselves, playing an even more active role in their foreign affairs. \n\n With the Bulgarian opposition furious over their loss in the recent elections in the country, they would be more than happy to have our support and backing in helping to bring about change in the nation. Through the 'National Endowment for Democracy', American money would be able flow directly to the UDF and affiliated organizations. Many of the more staunch liberal interventionists and vocal proponents of American hegemony in this new world, are fully in support of such an initiative - writing off concerns about interfering in a democratic election has little more than helping the Bulgarian people to discover democracy after so long under communist rule.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022960;The United Democratic Forces, still reeling from its recent defeat in the country's elections, has seemingly gained the backing of the United States in its fight to overturn its loss and demand a resignation of the current government. Already funding, technical aid, and help with coordination has allowed a rapid mobilization of forces across the nation - with the US itself ramping up pressure on Bulgaria and Mladenov's administration, threatening to exclude the nation from financial endeavors should they defy the demands of the opposition and US diplomats.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022961;The BSP, still in chaos from the resignation of many of its leadership who had helped in the nation's transition to a more western-oriented regime, has continued to face backlash and calls for a complete reversal of the 1990 elections by opposition forces. While counter-protests have risen in opposition to the demands of the opposition, the UDF with its funding and foreign aid has managed to overshadow them - growing its support with promises of US aid to the nation and fears of a return to the communist regime of only a few years ago. \n\n Already many with the BSP have prepared to completely concede to the opposition, divisions and rifts forming as pressure from within and without increasingly points towards fresh elections and the introduction of yet more reforms in an attempt to hold together a unified and stable Bulgaria.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8013807;With China still embroiled in war - now with itself rather than Japan - Xinjiang has once more been left as a functionally autonomous frontier of the Chinese state. Left to fend for itself, wracked with political and economic instability, and without much support from the rest of China the long-standing tensions between the ethnic Uyghur population and the ruling Chinese have since boiled over into a war that threatens China's loosening grip over its western reaches. \n\n Already the Uyghur people have risen up to win their liberation from China. With the 'Second East Turkestan Republic' standing triumphant in the north, and support from the USSR continuing to provide legitimacy, the position of the revolution against Chinese rule has never been stronger. Even still, there remain obstacles to creating a Uyghur state - the leadership of the new Republic is as divided as the Uyghur people on the future of the republic, with the only uniting factor being the threat of continued Chinese rule.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013808;For over a decade now the Soviets have been involved in the 'Frontier' of China, providing aid to Uyghur rebels, helping to organize political movements, and even briefly siding with the former governor of the region Sheng Shicai to advance the cause of socialism and equality within the province. The most recent manifestation of this support has been the Second East Turkestan Republic, made up of exiles that were based out of the USSR prior to their return. \n\n However, with the peace treaties that followed the Second World War there has come demands to 'withdraw' from the region entirely - facilitating a return to the Republic of China, which enjoys special privileges on the newly created UNSC. While many within the Soviet leadership are sure to take issue with the abandonment of the Uyghurs, Stalin has voiced his support in following through with the agreements reached - hoping instead to consolidate his influence among Eastern Europe and foster better relations with the advancing forces of Mao in China by facilitating the removal of the more traditionalist Uyghur leader Tore in favor of those more friendly to the prospect of peace.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013809;The Soviets have made a sudden move today by recalling Elihan Tore back to the Soviet Union. While Tore has served as the de facto head of the Second East Turkestan Republic since its creation, tension between he and the Soviet leadership has only flared in recent months. With the conclusion of the Second World War, and the surrender of both Japan and Germany aid from the Soviet Union has been replaced with increasing pressure to cede to at least some Chinese demands, demands that will be made easier with Tore's departure from the nation and power instead falling onto the more Moscow aligned Ehmetian Qasim.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013810;Hoping to put an end to hostilities that have plagued the province now for the past few years, the Xinjiang provincial government has come to us with an offer for a ceasefire and negotiations for an end to our aspirations for independence. While at first such an offer seems almost unthinkable to consider, they haven't come empty-handed. Instead, there are promises to work towards a compromise that will allow autonomy for our people and potential statehood within Xinjiang's existing government. Even still, such a move is likely to dash hopes of the more hardline members of our government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013811;East Turkestan, in a surprising move, has accepted our offer for a ceasefire. Already fighting is stopping across the nation - with only a few small skirmishes continuing in the more remote areas and among unaffiliated bands of rebels. While this on its own will do little to end tensions, it is a first step towards securing peace.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013812;Despite our best efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, negotiations have broken down yet again. With this final blow its likely the only solution to the issue of the Second East Turkestan republic will be a violent one. While our people are weary of war and our government unstable, we will persevere and attempt to quell unrest in China's furthest reaches.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013813;With the ceasefire already implemented, negotiations have been underway on a more permanent agreement with the Xinjiang government on the status of the East Turkestan Republic and the Uyghur people that for so long have faced repression at the hands of the Chinese. So far these negotiations have produced an interested proposal - one of a coalition government in which the leadership of East Turkestan will enjoy administrative and political power within the northern regions of the province in exchange for an end to hostilities and a reunification with China. While obviously this deal means an end to our statehood, the chances of it securing a future for the Uyghur people are surely worth it.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013814;The leadership of the rebellious north has accepted to our proposal to unite under the common banner as part of a coalition government! While this will limit Xinjiang's authority across the province, it is a small price to pay for stability and security. With luck, this still shaky relationship will prove to be lasting.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013815;With the decision of the Second East Turkestan Republic's leadership to reject our offer of a coalition government, a devastating blow has been dealt to the efforts for a peaceful resolution to one of the provinces many woes. Even the ceasefire, shaky and tenuous, has started to break - with reports of fighting breaking out once more coming in from across the north as it seems the only path forward is one of a military suppression of the northern regions of the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013816;With the surrender of the last holdouts of the 'Xinjiang' government to East Turkestani forces, the long-standing Chinese rule of the so-called 'Frontier' has ended. Already celebrations have started to take place in major cities as word spreads, with the leadership busy drafting a formalized constitution for a new state as they prepare for elections and the creation of more concrete governing structures. A vast majority of the leadership hopes to create a state modeled after either Mongolia or the Soviet Union, aiming to replicate the economic growth and industrialization in the relatively undeveloped East Turkestan - a desire opposed by more moderate figures that hope for a transitional phase before the Uyghur people push forward towards more hardline socialism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013817;The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has long stood as an ally to the Uyghur people, having supported the Second East Turkestan Republic and helped to educate and advise many of those that now find themselves in positions of power within its government. This on its own has driven many to desire a more Soviet aligned future for our new state, however two more major factors have turned us towards our comrades west - those being China and the emerging Cold War. \n\n It is hoped that Soviet alignment will provide protection from China, who will no doubt desire a reclamation of the region once the Civil War finally ends. Soviet protection would massively deter any efforts to undermine our independence. Not only that, but the emerging economic bloc of socialist nations headed by the Soviets also provides an opportunity to develop our abysmal economy that has been ruined by colonialism and years of war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013818;Decades of instability, warlordism, corruption war, social strife, and political infighting have seen China torn asunder. Nowhere is this current more evident than in Xinjiang, where the provincial government has been ousted and overthrown by rebel groups aligned with the Soviets who aim to destabilize and divide us for their own aims. However, the time has come to present this self-proclaimed state with an ultimatum - to join with a united China and cede power back to the legitimate government or to face an invasion from China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013819;With a KMT victory in the Chinese Civil War, the leader of China Chiang has presented us with an ultimatum regarding our separation from China and aspirations from statehood. He has asked that we lay down our weapons and arms, end our 'rebellion', cede power back to the Xinjiang regional government, and rejoin China - If we refuse, he has threatened to invade. While China's armies are likely heavily weakened from its Civil War, even the more hardline among the government are doubtful about how long an independent and isolated East Turkestan could stand up to the entire nation - though even still many are more than prepared to fight for their hard-earned freedom.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023800;With China still embroiled in war - now with itself rather than Japan - Xinjiang has once more been left as a functionally autonomous frontier of the Chinese state. Left to fend for itself, wracked with political and economic instability, and without much support from the rest of China the long-standing tensions between the ethnic Uyghur population and the ruling Chinese have since boiled over into a war that threatens China's loosening grip over its western reaches. \n\n Since 1944 Xinjiang has been struggling to contain the rebellious provinces in the North, with the self-proclaimed 'Second East Turkestan Republic' - with support from the Soviet Union - continuing to push for liberation and self-determination. While their goals, as of yet, remain out of reach the tenuous situation in the rest of the province has shaken faith in the current governor, as well as in the ability to move forward without significant change to the governing structures put in place by the KMT.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023801;Since the 1930s there have been a series of rebellions and conflicts within Xinjiang, mainly centered around the ethnic divide between the ruling Chinese and the native Uyghur population. Such conflict has fueled political instability, economic ruin, and a dwindling support for the institutions of the Republic of China. These matters were only made worse by the war with Japan and now the Civil War as they threaten to rend Xinjiang from China entirely. To that end many within the government are proposing a solution, hopefully permanent, to conflict in the Chinese frontier. A ceasefire would go a long way to securing stability in the region, and allow both the legitimate government as well as the self-proclaimed Uyghur state to work together to find common ground as they work towards a united China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023802;Facing a crumbling economy, social and political unrest, decreasing faith in the KMT government in the region, and a full on rebellion from the ethnic Uyghur population the central government in Beijing has decided to exert what little authority they have over the province. They are calling for the removal of the  current governor, Wu Zhongxin - a member of the right wing of the KMT and its CC Clique - who has served since 1944. Instead a more moderate figure, Zhang Zhizhong, has risen to replace him. \n\n Already the new governor has drawn criticism from the strong influence of the CC Clique in the region for his more left-leaning stance and the emphasis on cooperation with the rebel groups. Even still, many hope that Zhizhong will be able to finally bring stability to the province and return to under the direct influence of the rest of the mainland once more.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023803;With a ceasefire secured, now comes efforts for a lasting peace. One of the most plausible proposals, and likely the last chance for a non-violent resolution to the Uyghur issue, is one in which we offer to enter into a coalition with the rebel government in exchange for a cessation of hostilities and joint efforts on rebuilding Xinjiang as a Chinese province. Its likely that such a proposal will draw anger from more loyalist elements of the government - as well as the central government based in Nanjing - however it remains one of the few options given the situation within the province.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023804;Zhang Zhizhong has served as governor for little under a year now, rising to power mainly off of the failures of the previous regime - failures many feel he has done little to remedy. The province remains stricken by a failing economy and social unrest, and the controversial concessions to the Uyghur rebels as well as the perceived leftist alignment have instead placed the hopeful governor at odds with not only his more conservative rivals but the central government as well. Already he has been asked to step down, with the KMT presenting two possible replacements as they make their case to lead Xinjiang. \n\n Masud Sabri is currently the most favored of the two. Despite his controversial views regarding pan-Turkic nationalism and his background as an ethnic Uyghur, he is seen as a figure that can keep Soviet influence at bay, sway the Turkic population, and steer the province towards a more friendly KMT alignment. However, more radical right elements of the provincial KMT have instead advocated Bai Chongxi lead - hoping to secure their own influence over the province and strengthen their grip within the party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023805;With Zhizhong out of the picture, the time has come to address his legacy in the province. Despite only being in power for under a year, he had made substantial efforts to open up its politics and empower its Uyghur population - two things that have combined to weaken the government's position and undermine its authority. The KMT as a whole is almost unanimously united in opposing them and working to undo enough to secure its power - though even still a few voices have presented the idea of keeping the reforms, if only temporarily to help build faith and trust with a weary population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023806;While the Second East Turkestan Republic might be gone, its legacy is far from forgotten. The Uyghur continue to suffer under Xinjiang's rule, and the ineffective, unstable, and increasingly hostile government has made no significant progress in addressing their concerns. With minimal effort it may be possible to rekindle the flames of revolution among the people, though such a move would likely come with some controversy within China and the West - being seen as an act of aggression against an already struggling China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023807;Across the northeastern parts of the nation efforts are underway by the Soviets and Mongols to spread dissent among the Uyghur population. Calls to arm, socialist propaganda, and newsletters slandering the government have found their way among the population centers - fueling unrest and anger towards the government and further frustrating an already tense situation. Police and military forces, spread thin as they are, have already been dispatched to deal with a bulk of the unrest - with some in the government now demanding we make a move to try to assert ourselves against our increasingly belligerent neighbors.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023808;A wave of violence has swept across the northern and eastern parts of the province in recent days, with mobs of Uyghurs assaulting non-Muslims and their fellow believers alike in a display of hatred towards the Chinese administration. Local forces have thus far managed to keep some semblance of order, however as the flames continue to grow and reports of deaths and armed attacks mount it is becoming increasingly clear that reinforcement of these long rebellious regions will once more be needed. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023809;With unrest still sweeping the country it was only a matter of time before things spiraled even further out of control. During one of the more violent uprisings in Turfan, Ma general Chengxiang has reportedly been at the helm of what the locals are calling a massacre. While numbers and exact details are scarce, it would seem that even with reinforcements from the neighboring province of Qinghai we will find little respite as an even deeper wedge is driven between the local government and its people.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023810;Since mid 1947, and even before, skirmishes and small scale fighting has taken place along the border with the Mongolian People's Republic - with small changes having constantly taken place over the years. Such fighting mainly comes down to the continued communist support for Uyghur rebels, and has only worsened in severity as efforts continued to stop collaboration with rebel and attempted invasions of the province. Currently our forces are poised for yet another escalation, with the aim being to send a message to the Mongols and Soviets that Xinjiang is still capable of defending itself and continued interference in our affairs and people will not be tolerated. \n\n However, not all in the government are as keen on this plan. In particular more left-leaning elements believe any such escalation will be sufficient provocation to see yet another Soviet invasion - instead arguing that we continue efforts to win over the Uyghur people through peaceful concession while simply ignoring the efforts to undermine our government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023811;Long having raided our borders and harassed soldiers and civilians alike, the bandit warlords and petty cliques have again tried to provoke a response by escalating their attacks in recent days. Our forces have already repelled a bulk of the attacks, with Soviet and Mongolian air raids helping to further deter this recent spat of violence - stabilizing the borders and reversing the minimal changes that had taken place. However, some are not satisfied in merely pushing back the Chinese this time. Once before already Mongolia has had to temper its efforts in China, and more nationalist leaning members of the MPRP see this as the best opportunity to push for what we have desired so long - as well as to provide support for those sympathetic to us among the Uyghur population and the Xinjiang government such as the pro-Soviet Li Rihan. While its sure to draw criticism from both Moscow and China alike, it is likely this will be one of the few chances to secure our interests in China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023812;Continued troubles have prompted yet another change to the leadership of Xinjiang by the central government. Once more the more conservative factions of the Xinjiang clique have put forward a candidate in opposition to the favored by the KMT's leadership. Currently Burhan Shahidi, a more moderate figuring promising to bring economic prosperity back to the province and a former member of the now deposed Shicai's government, is the favored to be appointed to the position of governor. He is opposed by the traditionalist and hardline nationalist Yulbars Khan, who has vowed a ruthless and merciless crackdown on dissent, as well as a vocal and zealous opposition to the communist forces threatening the province.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023813;A proposed plan to help stabilize the ruinous economy of Xinjiang has been put forward by more moderate elements of the Xinjiang government as they scramble to salvage the situation. The move, aiming to restore local currency and combat inflation, has been met with opposition from more hardline elements that see it as a betrayal of the Republic of China - though their voices have thus far on mostly deaf ears as rising costs and dwindling coffers threaten to further deepen the provinces woes.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023814;With our victory in the mainland, we now set our sights on the wayward province of Xinjiang. While it has mostly escaped the fighting that raged during the civil war, it still remains nominally and legally a part of the now defeated Republic of China. To fully secure our victory over the rightist factions of the KMT we should send an ultimatum to the leadership of this effectively autonomous province demanding they surrender to the legitimate and rightful government of China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023815;A delegation from the communist government, who now stands triumphant in China, headed by Deng Liqun has arrived to offer to negotiation the terms of our surrender to the new government in China. Many within the government have already signaled their willingness to defect, with former governor Zhizhong cooperating with the new communist government and calling for a full concession to their demands.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023816;Decades of instability, warlordism, corruption war, social strife, and political infighting have seen China torn asunder. Nowhere is this current more evident than in Xinjiang, China's frontier province that has long enjoyed a light touch from a central government too plagued by its own troubles to exert more than a passing amount of influence. That all changes now, however. With the civil war at an end, the communists defeated, the time has come to call on the KMT within the province to fall in line with the rest of China. While we are confident that the weakened clique in charge will not put up much of a fight, our weary forces are prepared to take up arms once more to ensure lasting peace. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023817;With the Nationalist Government triumphant the Generalissimo himself, Chiang Kai-shek, has personally seen to it that Xinjiang be brought back in line with the rest of the mainland. While we have enjoyed autonomy thus far, it has come at a price - and many within the Xinjiang branch of the KMT have expressed little dissent at the prospect of coming under more direct rule once more, with only more left-leaning elements and the Uyghur rebels hoping for a continued independence in the region.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230155;Oil and Natural Gas have always been a part of the Romanian economy since the Victorian Age, however outdated equipment, facilities, and production methods have hampered its growth. To this end Ceausescu has presented a plan to modernize and revamp much of the nationâs oil and natural gas production to not only bring them up to standard but to challenge the oil producing Giants in West Asia. To accomplish this he has proposed spending a large amount of Romania's current reserves - backed by western capital and loans from the IMF - to divert to this new project. However, opponents have claimed that such a feat is likely to set Romania back enormously before it produces any benefits - hoping instead that the funds be used for more productive endeavors.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082321;For many long decades Nicolae Ceausescu has led Romania now, however with his advancing age and the changes happening across the world questions have begun to arise as to who should replace him. While the most obvious choice to many of the leader's supporters is that of his seeming heir apparent, Nicu Ceausescu - also his youngest son, many other prominent members of his family have involved themselves in political life. His brother-in-law and former president of the council of ministers Manea Manescu has proven competent, and Nicolae's daughter has herself become vocal in politics while earning herself the nickname 'Comrade Zoia' among many. \n\n There remain those in the party however that hope to see an end to any political dynasty before it can begin - with much of the remaining opposition within the Communist Party supporting a transfer of power over to more competent and meritocratic leaders.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082322;Having herself been heavily involved in the fields of mathematics and having made contributions to it that earned her renown beyond the borders of her small country, it comes as little surprise that Zoia Ceausescu has begun a campaign within the party to push towards automation of the Romanian economy. Supporters of the campaign argue that it will improve the efficiency of state planning and help bring Romania forward into the start of the information age.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082323;With automation efforts already implemented or in progress across the country, a new emerging idea has been pushed to the front of Romanian technological development - that of a national network as part of a larger global internet. While such a thing still remains in its infancy, utilizing this new technology in Romania would further bolster efforts to automate the economy, as well as bring in a new age of culture and interconnectedness among the socialist world.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082324;With her health declining from a combination of age and poor habits, Comrade Zoia today has announced she is stepping down from her position of leadership in the Romanian government. Instead she has signaled a support for her heir to continue to lead the nation in her stead - calling upon her supporters in the party to help elevate them through the ranks. \n\n However, the removal of such a prominent figure from politics and the uncertainty brought on by an inexperienced opponent has enticed many in the opposition within the party - with them presenting their own candidates in hopes of ousting the Ceausescu dynasty completely.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082325;With age beginning to take its toll on Nicu, the Romanian leader today has made a statement that he will be resigning from his position in government. In his wake he has tapped one of his kin to lead the nation, calling upon supporters within the party to back this heir apparent in their rise just as they had backed his own decades before. \n\n However, the removal of such a prominent figure from politics and the uncertainty brought on by an inexperienced opponent has enticed many in the opposition within the party - with them presenting their own candidates in hopes of ousting the Ceausescu dynasty completely.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082326;Manescu has announced his resignation from his position of leader today, citing his declining health. Instead he has called on the members of the party to support the son of the late leader of Romania, Nicu Ceausescu, to lead the nation. Calling on the clique created by his brother-in-law within the party to ensure the Ceausescu family continues to remain dominant in politics. \n\n However, the removal of such a prominent figure from politics and the uncertainty brought on by an inexperienced opponent has enticed many in the opposition within the party - with them presenting their own candidates in hopes of ousting the Ceausescu dynasty completely.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082327;Ceausescu's leadership has left a scar on Romania's politics. Its institutions have been weakened, the party's credibility damaged, and the nation's economy left in a dire state. However, with the dictator now gone and power returning to the people through the communist party and its institutions - the process of setting the nation back on its proper course can finally begin. However, a major obstacle still remains. While the opposition to Ceausescu had united to ensure he could not name his own son as leader of the nation, this short-lived alliance has broken down in its entirety. Instead two major factions have formed - one coalescing around the Stalinist-Reformist Apostol in the hopes of setting Romania back on the path of a more hardline approach, and those that have opted to back the openly liberal reformist Iliescu and his plans to transform Romanian politics along the lines of the Soviet reformists.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082328;Gheorghe Apostol has served Romania dutiful now for many years, however the Stalinist-oriented reformer and his ideas have seeming run their course. Today he has announced that he is stepping down from his post, leaving the door open for new leadership to arise within Romania. Already his faction of the party, empowered by his leadership and policies, have put forward a replacement of their own choosing - one that will surely face little challenge from more reformist or moderate minded opposition.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082329;Iliescu's ideas have changed the face of the Socialist Republic of Romania forever, and his legacy will carry on to another generation of Romanian leadership as he announces his stepping down from positions of power within the government.

EVTDESC80100144;Afghan politics has been in a stalemate ever since the student protest that propelled leftist elements of Afghan society into a position of power, with a standoff between the traditional reactionary elite rallying around the monarch and the new progressive legislature that has been struggling to bring real change to the country. For the first few months such a tense situation seemed like it could come to compromise, especially with the pro-Monarchist Democratic Party offering to act as a liaison between the interests of the monarchy and that of those yearning for increased freedom and rights. However, rumors have begun to surface that the king is planning a dissolution of the legislature pending new elections - with the police and military prepared to use force to ensure compliance. With radical elements among the legislature and a population emboldened by a previous victory - the nation seems set for what could erupt into revolution or civil war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80100145;Gaining power within Afghanistan and proclaiming a Democratic Republic alone are not enough. In order to build socialism in the country a large-scale campaign to industrialize and develop the long neglected areas of the country is needed. The governing coalition, dominated by the reformist leaning Parcham, has proposed a series of sweeping reforms to aid in the reorientation of the economy towards the path of socialism as well as to revise and fund education across the nation. This has been paired with plans to integrate the economy with existing socialist nations across Europe, Asia, and Africa - hoping to also expand the economy and begin to tap into the long ignored wealth of Afghanistan.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

crimea_ascension_title;Annexation of Crimea;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
crimea_ascension_desc;Crimea, having a historical large Russian speaking community, is a natural part of our nation. With the Crimean government aligned with our interests it should surely be possible to facilitate an ascension of Crimea back to the Russian Federation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ukraine_neo_soviet_title;Reunification with Ukraine;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ukraine_neo_soviet_desc;Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia share a shared culture heritage - all being Slavic nations that have historically been united within the same state. Independence has harmed both peoples, and with the government of Ukraine aligned with hardline communist interests as well as our own we can finally begin to recover from the traumatic destruction of our nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120700;The changes that had been brought by Gorbachev and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have left Crimea's future unclear and murky. The Supreme Soviet of Crimea had previously declared the peninsula's autonomy within the USSR separate from Ukraine, however with the impossibility of it remaining with its ASSR status other options have had to be considered. Currently the two most reasonable visions for the future are Crimea agreeing to join the independent states of Ukraine, or Russia - with arguments for both being made by the competing Tatar and Russian interests within the nominally independent region's politics. However, some more hardline elements have proposed instead that Crimea should continue with the 'Parade of Sovereignties' and declare itself a fully independent state - though its likely neither Ukraine nor Russia will take kindly to the upset such a move would cause.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120701;The Supreme Soviet of Crimea, as one of the last moves they are set to make, has reaffirmed the peninsula's attachment to Ukraine. Plans have already been laid out and agreements reached on the region's continued autonomy - with many across the nation welcoming the sign of hope and order in such a tumultuous time. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120702;Crimea has announced plans today to see itself become a part of the newly created Russian Federation, with its status set to be the same as any other of Russia's existing republics. Thanks to its large Russian speaking population such a move is likely to cause only minor stirs in the world stage - though perhaps its biggest impact will be on assuring the Russian people that a future still exists for a powerful and united state.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120703;In yet another devastating move, coming just a few weeks after the Soviet dissolution, Crimea has announced its intentions to fully separate from Ukraine. While the peninsula was recognized as part of Ukraine during the time of the Soviet Union, few frameworks have survived the collapse and little remains to prevent such a move. Even still, some believe Crimea's move should be met with force, if only to deter similar movements elsewhere in the nation or in those of our fellow former Soviet Republics.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120704;Currently the Supreme Soviet of Crimea has managed to steer the nation, though the old Soviet era institutions have yet to be made fully independent of their counterparts that now lie in the past - and cracks have begun to form and show as discussions intensify as to the future of the nation. Currently leading are a band of hardline Tatar Marxists that hope to preserve some shred of Leninism - arguing that the fate of the USSR can be avoided with reform and hoping to ally with the remnants of the communist camp to ensure its survival in the new European order. However, dissent has not been absent in Crimea, and the streets continue to see demonstrators pushing for democratization and western-style reform.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120705;Crimea, though having a large Russian population that has been present for many decades, has not always been Russian. Instead the Russian speakers share the peninsula with Tatars that have historically called it home - tracing their origin back even further than the Russians themselves. As such, tensions - though mild - have persisted in regards to cultural and linguistic rights. While many parties are content to see both languages enjoy status - many more favor one or the other, aiming to continue efforts to either Russify or deRussify Crimea. \n\n With Russian centric parties now in the lead of politics, questions have arisen as to which position we should take. Many believe it would be worth isolating more nationalist elements of the population in exchange for preserving the rights of Tatars, though ultimately in either case portions of the population are likely to take issue.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120706;Crimea, though having a large Russian population that has been present for many decades, has not always been Russian.

While many parties are content to see both languages enjoy status - many more favor one or the other, aiming to continue efforts to either Russify or deRussify Crimea. \n\n With Tatar centric parties now in the lead of politics, questions have arisen as to which position we should take. The sheer size of the Russian population has steered many politicians away from the prospect of coming to arms with them via a campaign to promote Tatar culture alone, however even still nationalists have remained adamant that there be efforts to remove Russian influence - claiming that it is a threat to the peninsula as a whole.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120707;Protests and riots continue across Tatarstan as nationalists push for radical change and a full declaration of independence from Russia. Presently the situation with - still nominal - parent nation is nebulous. The leader, Mintimer Shaimiev, declared sovereignty after the coup, which he had voiced his support for, had failed. However, since then no new steps have been taken to move towards a solution to the current situation, and pressure from nationalist groups, Russian speakers, and liberals has only grown with the dissolution of the Soviet Union - casting doubts on the future of the small autonomous region.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120708;In hopes of appeasing nationalists Shaimiev has announced a referendum on the sovereignty of Tatarstan set to be held soon. While its unlikely to significantly alter the status quo, it has renewed hopes of momentum pushing the region towards a definitive status. However, some doubt both the legality and the legitimacy of such a referendum - with claims already emerging that Russian speakers are underrepresented and that attempts to influence the results have been taken by the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120709;In a surprising, but pleasant, move today Tatarstan has announced that their region has voted overwhelming for a federation with Russia. At a time when many in the country fear for their future, this will surely be seen as a win for the government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120710;In yet another blow to Yeltsin's presidency, Tatarstan has announced that they have reaffirmed their commitment to the region's sovereign status through a referendum. While it has been stated to the leadership of this rebellious province that no such vote would be recognized, there is little the current government can do in its present state - with a military solution almost certainly proving more costly than it would be worth. Instead, many hope continued pressure will be enough to see Tatarstan reverse its direction - relying in particular on the Russian speakers to push for reunification.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120711;Tatarstan continues to work under the leadership of the Supreme Soviet and its Speaker - with the economy and laws continuing as they were under Gorbachev. However, such a status quo cannot last forever. Plans are currently in motion to draft a new constitution for the nation, with the most prominent proposal being the proclamation of a Republic and the continued transition towards a market economy - with concessions towards more nationalist forces hopefully helping to gain even more popular support among the ethnic Tatar population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120712;Negotiations with Russia have once again begun on the ultimate fate of Tatarstan. Currently a final ultimatum has been presented - with assurances of self-governance and cultural autonomy being offered in exchange for joining the federation. With the current situation of Tatarstan, and the geography of the region making full independence problematic, many feel it would be in our best interest to accept.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120713;Tatarstan has announced that they are finally ready to sign the Federation Treaty and join the Russian Federation. While they had previously left their ultimate fate up in the air with vague declarations of 'sovereignty', assurances of autonomy have since swayed them. With any hope, this move will convince other republics that they will continue to have a place as equals within Russia.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8120714;Even with significant concessions, the Tatarstani leadership have continued to refuse to sign any agreement on a federation with Russia - effectively declaring themselves independent in the process. Such an affront to Russian national unity - now more important than ever as Russia faces political crisis and economic unrest - must be met with force. While Russia's new army is still untested, the leadership feel that the restoration of order in the region is more than enough to prove its continued might.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8213130;Elections are set to be held for the National Council, the second such elections to be held since Austria's liberation just a year prior. Much like the previous, only a small handful of parties are set to contest the elections, with the largest being the People's Party and Socialist Party - both of which seek a more unified Austria. The Communist Party of Austria, along with smaller leftist groups, also hopes to contest the elections - aiming to see electoral success amid the continued developments in the Soviet occupied eastern portions of the nation. /n/n Unlike the previous postwar election, held in the chaotic aftermath of the Second World War, many vocal supporters of the former nazi regime will regain their voting rights. Already a party has emerged to try to cater to these voters, calling itself the 'Federation of Independents'. While it stylizes itself as a national liberal party, many elements contain former members of the nazi regime and espouse open pro-German sentiment - drawing a weary gaze from many hoping for a free and independent Austrian Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8213131;With Austria's situation stabilizing, the time has once more come to call upon the people to take part in elections for the National Council. The People's Party and Socialist Party hope to maintain their coalition, while the communists have united under the Austrian People's Opposition. The Federation of Independents, now facing internal strife between the increasingly disparate factions of their party, also hopes to contest the elections - running on the same platform of national liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8213132;In accordance with our constitution, it is once more time for elections to the National Council of Austria. With the political scene of the nation now beginning to take shape once again, parties that have established themselves have begun to campaign in earnest for the people's vote. In addition to the Austrian People's party, running on a conservative platform, and the Socialist Party of Austria, with its social democratic values, there is also the ever-present Communist Party of Austria - as well as a new party hoping to be a 'Third Force' in Austrian politics, calling itself the Freedom Party of Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8213133;In accordance with our constitution, it is once more time for elections to the National Council of Austria. With the changing political climate, the both the People's Party and the Socialist Party have maintained their dominance in Austrian politics. However, other forces continue to influence Austrian politics from the wayside. Both the Progressive Green forces - united under a banner of so called 'Green Politics' and environmental advocacy - and the far-right Freedom Party of Austria fight to break the dominance of the established parties, to vastly different ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8022808;Despite the reforms carried out by the now reformed Albanian socialists to model the still nominally Socialist Republic into a more pluralistic state, many within the opposition continue to voice their hatred of the regime and desire to go even further still. With demonstrations still plaguing the nation, splits between more radical and moderate factions of the newly created Socialist Party of Albania, and pressure from abroad to continue the move towards capitalism  many are seeing the new elections as a referendum on the direction of the nation rather than merely a tool for the peoples will to be carried out. Its likely that any opposition victory will result in a final transition towards a western-style nation, while the Socialist Party is content to continue to slowly inch on with its reforms and maintain the current system as it works with a now foreign and unfamiliar world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
