EVT_8008753_NAME;Operation Litani;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8008753_DESC;The rebels in the south, most of whom are Palestinian refugees, have crossed the Sidon border and attacked Israel, who is now occupying land up to the Litani River.

EVT_19471947_NAME;An end to the diaspora;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_19471947_DESC;The history of the chosen people is the longest of any - but it is a sad history. It is one of slavery. It is one of oppression. It is one of ghettos, genocide, pogroms, inquisitions, broken glass, forced conversions, and intolerance. It is one of diaspora.\nSeared into the Jewish national consciousness is the Shoah, in which two-thirds of European Jews were systematically exterminated. This, and the whole history of the diaspora, is a natural consequence of living among gentiles.\nWe shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die peacefully in our own homes. The world will be freed by our liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness. And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare, will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_19471947_A;We will fight for our homeland.;;;;;;;;;;x
