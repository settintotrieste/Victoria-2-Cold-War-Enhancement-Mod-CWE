space_station_invention;Space Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_station_invention_desc;A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting a human crew in orbit for an extended period of time that lacks major propulsion or landing systems. Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to dock to transfer crew and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_docking;Orbital Docking;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_docking_desc;A space rendezvous is a set of orbital maneuvers during which two spacecraft, one of which is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance. Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities and position vectors of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spacewalk;Space Suit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spacewalk_desc;A space suit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, vacuum and temperature extremes. Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are necessary for extravehicular activity (EVA), work done outside spacecraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
man_in_orbit;Human Spaceflight Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
man_in_orbit_desc;Human spaceflight is spaceflight with a crew or passengers aboard a spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

space_capable_icbm;Basic ICBMs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_capable_icbm_desc;Early ICBMs had limited precision, which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets, such as cities. They were seen as a "safe" basing option, one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack. Attacks against military targets (especially hardened ones) still demanded the use of a more precise, manned bomber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

coal_power_plant;Coal-fired Power Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
coal_power_plant_desc;A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverised and then burned in a pulverised coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines that turn generators. Thus chemical energy stored in coal is converted successively into thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gas_power_plant;Gas-fired Power Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gas_power_plant_desc;A gas-fired power plant is a type of fossil fuel power station in which chemical energy stored in natural gas, which is mainly methane, is converted successively into: thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy. Although they cannot exceed the Carnot cycle limit for conversion of heat energy into useful work the excess heat may be used in cogeneration plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nuclear_power_plant;Nuclear Power Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

natural_gas_processing;Natural Gas Processing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
natural_gas_processing_desc;Natural gas, is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oil_power_plant;Oil Power Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
oil_power_plant_desc;Heavy fuel oil was once a significant source of energy for electric power generation. After oil price increases of the 1970s, oil was displaced by coal and later natural gas. Distillate oil is still important as the fuel source for diesel engine power plants used especially in isolated communities not interconnected to a grid. Liquid fuels may also be used by gas turbine power plants, especially for peaking or emergency service. Of the three fossil fuel sources, oil has the advantages of easier transportation and handling than solid coal, and easier on-site storage than natural gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
