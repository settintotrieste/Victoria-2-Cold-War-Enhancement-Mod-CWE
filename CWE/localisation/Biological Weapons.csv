EVTDESC1412061;Biological warfare is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction. None of these are conventional weapons, which are deployed primarily for their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential.;;;;;;;;;;x

develop_vaccine_title;Develop a vaccine to counteract the Biological Weapons ravaging our nation;;;;;;;;;;x
develop_vaccine_desc;A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognise the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognise and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.;;;;;;;;;;x
