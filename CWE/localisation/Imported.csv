EVTNAME6016818;Constitutional Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6016818;"Countless have quietly, orderly, soberly, peaceably but firmly asked of their rulers to do justice: and their rulers have turned a deaf ear to that protest. Countless asked permission to detail their wrongs, and enforce their claims for RIGHT, and the 'House' has resolved they should not be heard! Countless of the slave-class have holden out the olive branch of peace and sought the principle of EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW - and the privileged have refused to enter into a treaty! The same class is to be a slave class still. The assumption of inferiority is still to be maintained. The people are not to be free."\nWhen the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch promised the people the right to vote, they were expecting their voices to be heard - instead, the monarch overruled the election results. In $CAPITAL$, a crowd clamours for their rights to be respected. This blatant disregard of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ constitution is spreading unrest, locking the government and damaging our international reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22592;Military Base Close in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22592;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22591;Overgrown Railways in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22591;What once was one of the arteries of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry, the railway in $PROVINCENAME$ fell into such disrepair that it's path is barely visible and its tracks are unusable. Economic recession has hit $STATENAME$ harshly for the last years and without money from $CAPITAL$ being invested, most of the railways in $STATENAME$ are in such a state that they will need to be rebuilt to become train-worthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22590;$PROVINCENAME$ Old Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22590;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom. Hit with a severe economic recession in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politicians in $CAPITAL$ have no money to spend on repairing and maintaining non-essential staff and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME60168004;$PROVINCENAME$ Military Base Damaged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60168004;Bullets whistled as the morning came in $PROVINCENAME$. Enemy soldiers engaged our troops in the roads, their artillery hoaring in the distance. Our local military base was spearheading the defense, soldiers taking turns crouching to reload and standing up to fire at the enemies. A group of enemy commandos snuck in one of the base's armouries and managed to blow it up with explosives, severely damaging the base's structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME60168005;Sabotage in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60168005;A cargo train hurriedly passed by the $PROVINCENAME$ railroad during dusk while human silhouettes snuck out of the railroad. They hit the wooden keys used to hold the rails in chairs with a hammer, diverting the train to a more sinuous track while forward other figures moved objects in the rail. The train was wrecked by putting objects on the high rail at a curve, and contained tons of supplies for our troops fighting in the province. Later on that night, one of our railroad bridges in $PROVINCENAME$ was burned to the ground, with no culprits found. These actions are believed to be the work of the enemy and severely crippled our railroad network.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC201900;Sometimes the monarch just isn't there. Dying without a suitable or old enough heir, becoming incapable or senile while the government enters a deadlock. Sometimes the monarch is so ill that the government doesn't work and sometimes he's just away and someone incompetent was left to take care of things in his stead. Regardless of the reason, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is currently going through a regency. We can expect some instability in the years ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
