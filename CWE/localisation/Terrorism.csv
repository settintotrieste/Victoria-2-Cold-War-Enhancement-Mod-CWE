EVT_1511100_NAME;$YEAR$ UN Convention on Terrorism;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1963_un_terror_convention_desc;The 1963 Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft authorised the aircraft commander to impose reasonable measures, including restraint, on any person he or she had reason to believe has committed or was about to commit such an act, where necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft. It required states signed up to the convention to take custody of offenders and to return control of the aircraft to the lawful commander.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_1511100_A;Terrorists beware!;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1970_un_terror_convention_desc;The Hague Hijacking Convention (formally the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft) is a multilateral treaty by which states agree to prohibit and punish aircraft hijacking. The convention does not apply to customs, law enforcement or military aircraft, thus it applies exclusively to civilian aircraft. The convention only addresses situations in which an aircraft takes off or lands in a place different from its country of registration. The convention sets out the principle of aut dedere aut judicare—that a party to the treaty must prosecute an aircraft hijacker if no other state requests his or her extradition for prosecution of the same crime.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_1511101_A;Terrorists, get a job!;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1971_un_terror_convention_desc;The Convention criminalises the following behaviour: Committing an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if it is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft, destroying an aircraft being serviced or damaging such an aircraft in such a way that renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight, placing or causing to be placed on an aircraft a device or substance which is likely to destroy or cause damage to an aircraft, destroying or damaging air navigation facilities or interfering with their operation if it is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft, communicating information which is known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight, attempting any of 1–5, and being an accomplice to any of 1–6.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_1511102_A;Our skies must be safe!;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1973_un_terror_convention_desc;Parties to the convention agree to criminalise the commission of murders or kidnappings of internationally protected persons as well as violent attacks against the official premises, private accommodation, or means of transport of such persons. Parties to the convention also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. "Internationally protected persons" is a term created by the convention, and refers explicitly to heads of state, heads of government, foreign ministers, ambassadors, other official diplomats, and members of their families.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1979_un_terror_convention_desc;The Hostages Convention (formally the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages) is a United Nations treaty by which states agree to prohibit and punish hostage taking. The treaty includes definitions of "hostage" and "hostage taking" and sets out the principle of aut dedere aut judicare: a party to the treaty must prosecute a hostage taker if no other state requests extradition for prosecution of the same crime.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_1511104_A;Hostage takers are pathetic cowards;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1988_un_terror_convention_desc;Any person commits an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally: (a) seizes or exercises control over a ship by force or threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, or (b) performs an act of violence against a person on board a ship if that act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship, or (c) destroys a ship or causes damage to a ship or to its cargo which is likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship, or (d) places or causes to be placed on a ship, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that ship, or cause damage to that ship or its cargo which endangers or is likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship, or (e) destroys or seriously damages maritime navigational facilities or seriously interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship, or (f) communicates information which he knows to be false, thereby endangering the safe navigation of a ship, or (g) injures or kills any person, in connection with the commission or the attempted commission of any of the offences set forth in subparagraphs (a) to (f).;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1991_un_terror_convention_desc;A state that ratifies the Convention agrees to prohibit the manufacture, storage, transport, or entry of unmarked plastic explosives in its territory. Plastic explosives are not prohibited by the treaty, but it mandates that when they are produced they are marked with a chemical taggant (specified in the treaty's Technical Annex) which can facilitate future identification purposes. The Convention also establishes an International Explosives Technical Commission, which is composed of experts in the field explosives manufacturing and detection. The Commission can propose amendments to the Technical Annex of the treaty.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1997_un_terror_convention_desc;The Terrorist Bombings Convention (formally the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) is a 1997 United Nations treaty designed to criminalise terrorist bombings. The convention describes terrorist bombings as the unlawful and intentional use of explosives in public places with intention to kill, to injure, or to cause extensive destruction to compel a government or an international organisation to do or to abstain from doing some act. The convention also seeks to promote police and judicial co-operation to prevent, investigate and punish those acts. As of September 2016, the convention has been ratified by 169 states.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1999_un_terror_convention_desc;Article 2.1 defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offense committed by "any person" who "by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out" an act "intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organisation to do or to abstain from doing any act." State parties to this treaty also commit themselves to the freezing and seizure of funds intended to be used for terrorist activities and to share the forfeited funds with all state parties. Moreover, state parties commit themselves not to use bank secrecy as a justification for refusing to co-operate in the suppression of terrorist financing.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1511109;Guided by Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), the CTC works to bolster the ability of United Nations Member States to prevent terrorist acts both within their borders and across regions.

The CTC is assisted by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), which carries out the policy decisions of the Committee, conducts expert assessments of each Member State and facilitates counter-terrorism technical assistance to countries.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1511119;Unbeknownst to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intelligence, a cell of militant terrorists in $PROVINCENAME$ have chosen now to carry out their plan.

Yet others will leave for greener pastures. One thing is clear: no matter how strong the response, and no matter how many other such groups have been found and stopped before, every attack that slips through the cracks will invite others unless the international community takes strong action.;;;;;;;;;;x
