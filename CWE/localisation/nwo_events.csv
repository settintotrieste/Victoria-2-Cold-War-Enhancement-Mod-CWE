EVTDESC8018201;Sallal ordered that the military academy in San'a go on full alert — opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence as soon as the shelling of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the telephone exchange, Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security). The battle at the palace continued until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC80182011;On the royalist side, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel supplied military aid, and Britain gave covert support, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and were supplied warplanes from the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were involved. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and weapons. Despite several military actions and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate by the mid-1960s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018202;Saudi Arabia, fearing Nasserist encroachment, moved troops along its border with Yemen, as the King Hussein of Jordan dispatched his Army chief of staff for discussions with al-Badr's uncle, Prince Hassan. Between October 2–8 four Saudi cargo planes left Saudi Arabia loaded with arms and military material for Yemeni royalist tribesmen however, the pilots defected to Aswan. Ambassadors from Bonn, London, Washington D.C. and Amman supported the Imam while ambassadors from Cairo, Rome and Belgrade declared support for the republican revolution. The USSR was the first nation to recognise the new republic, and Nikita Khrushchev cabled Sallal: "Any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union." The United States was concerned that the conflict might spread to other parts of the Middle East. President John F. Kennedy rushed off notes to Nasser, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Hussein and Sallal. His plan was that Nasser's troops should withdraw from Yemen while Saudi Arabia and Jordan halted their aid to the Imam. Nasser agreed to pull out his forces only after Jordan and Saudi Arabia "stop all aggressive operations on the frontiers".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018203;The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognised the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018204;The Yemenite War of 1972 was a short military conflict between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The war, initiated by the YAR, started on 26 September 1972, the tenth anniversary of the start of the North Yemen Civil War the fighting mostly consisted of border clashes. During the conflict, the YAR was supplied by Saudi Arabia and the PDRY by the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC8018205;The Yemenite War of 1979 was a short military conflict between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The war developed out of a breakdown in relations between the two countries after the president of North Yemen, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, was killed on 24 June 1978 and Salim Rubai Ali, a moderate Marxist who had been working on a proposed merger between the two Yemens, was murdered two days later. The hostility of the rhetoric from the new leadership of both countries escalated, leading to small scale border fighting, which then in turn escalated into a full blown war in February 1979. North Yemen appeared on the edge of a decisive defeat after a three-front invasion by South Yemeni combined arms formation, however this was prevented by a successful mediation in the form of the Kuwait Agreement of 1979, which resulted in Arab League forces being deployed to patrol the North-South border. An agreement to unite both countries was also signed, although was not implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

He had been criticised by the people of $COUNTRY$ for failing to reform as promised and taking dictatorial actions. The pro-Russian opposition government which seized power surprised and disappointed Russia by calling for a widely popular referendum towards a democratic parliamentary system, the first of its kind in Central Asia.

EVT_8008103_DESC;In the south, ethnic Uzbeks have been highly active in the local economy. In $COUNTRYCULTURE$ public opinion, they have attempted to turn this economic clout into political power, promoting Uzbek nationalism, and destroying Kyrgyzstan's unity. During the general mayhem of the $YEAR$ Revolution, exiles from the Uzbek minority claim they were assaulted and driven to Uzbekistan, with some 400,000 citizens becoming internally displaced. Victims testify to mass killing, gang rape, and torture, primarily in the cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad. The violence required the interim government to declare a state of emergency in an attempt to take control of the situation. Uzbekistan launched a limited troop incursion early on, but withdrew and opened its borders to Uzbek refugees.

However, the degree of support has been subject to debate, and accusations of greater involvement have been denied by Iran.

Badoglio was not in favour of the Italian-German Pact of Steel and was pessimistic about the chances of Italian success in any European war but he did not oppose the decision of Mussolini and the King to declare war on France and Great Britain. Following the Italian army's poor performance in the invasion of Greece in December 1940, he resigned from the General Staff. Badoglio was replaced by Ugo Cavallero. Due to increased tensions with the Soviet Union, the British government saw Pietro Badoglio as a guarantor of an anti-communist post-war Italy. Consequently, Badoglio was never tried for Italian war crimes committed in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1410074;On March 4, 1948, charges against Graziani were presented to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. The commission was presented with evidence of the Italian policy of systematic terrorism and Graziani’s self-admitted intention to execute all Amharas authorities, and cited a telegram from Graziani to General Nasi, in which Graziani had written, “Keep in mind also that I have already aimed at the total destruction of Abyssinian chiefs and notables and that this should be carried out completely in your territories.” The UN commission agreed that there was a prima facie case against eight Italians, including Graziani. The British Foreign Office consistently opposed Ethiopia’s inclusion in the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the trial on Italian crimes committed during the 1935–1936 invasion. Ethiopian efforts to bring Graziani to trial were frustrated by intransigence from both Italy and Britain, the attempts were finally abandoned in a deal with the Foreign Office, whose support the Government of the Ethiopian Empire considered essential for its Imperial claim on Eritrea. In 1948, an Italian tribunal condemned Graziani to 19 years. However, he served only four months of his sentence, because his lawyers demonstrated that he "received orders".;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_8002631_DESC;The 1995 Quebec referendum was the second referendum to ask voters in the Canadian province of Quebec whether Quebec should proclaim national sovereignty and become an independent country, with the condition precedent of offering a political and economic agreement to Canada. The culmination of multiple years of debate and planning after the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords, the referendum was launched solely by the provincial Parti Québécois government of Jacques Parizeau. Historically, the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a very close 50.58 percent for the no vote to 49.42 percent for the yes vote margin.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVT_32520_DESC;Republics of the Union have finally become free and independent, but despite their formally sovereign and independent status in the Union they were, in fact, mere administrative divisions, and their borders were sometimes made economically comfortable for the Union's authorities, rather then ethinically correct. In 1954, due to impossibility to adequately supply the Crimean peninsula with electricity, food and most of production from Russia, it was decided by Presidiums of Supreme Soviets of Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR to transfer ethnically diverse (but mostly Russian) peninsula from Russia to Ukraine. The thing is Presidiums had no right to do so without positive votes from the Supreme Councils. Whether there was such votes there are still speculations to these days. Nobody cared while we were parts of one country, but now we may get a conflict because of Russian-populated peninsula become a part of another country.

Clashes between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The conflicts included the Korean War in the beginnings of the decade and the beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik I. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons, this created a politically conservative climate. The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia occurred in 1950s and accelerated in the following decade. The 1960s have become synonymous with the new, radical, and subversive events and trends of the period, which continued to develop in the following decades. Several governments turned to the left in the early 1960s. In the United States, John F. Kennedy, a Keynesian and staunch anti-communist who pushed for centre-left social reforms such as civil rights for African Americans and healthcare for the elderly and the poor, was elected to the Presidency;;;;;;;;;;X

Ideological debate between the Communist parties of Russia and China also concerned the possibility of peaceful coexistence with the capitalist West. Yet, to the Chinese public, Mao Zedong proposed a belligerent attitude towards capitalist countries, an initial rejection of peaceful coexistence, which he perceived as Marxist revisionism from the Soviet Union. Moreover, since 1956, China and the USSR had progressively diverged about Marxist ideology, and, by 1961, when the doctrinal differences proved intractable, the Communist Party of China formally denounced the Soviet variety of Communism as a product of 'Revisionist Traitors', i.e., the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Nikita Krushchev.;;;;;;;;;;X

She performed the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. Beatrix was rarely quoted directly in the press during her reign since the government information service made it a condition of interviews that she may not be quoted. This policy was introduced shortly after her inauguration, reportedly to protect her from political complications that may arise from 'off-the-cuff' remarks.;;;;;;;;;;X

As king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year.

EVT_8006706_NAME;Operation Black Tulip;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8006706_DESC;Operation Black Tulip was a plan proposed in 1945 to forcibly deport all Germans from the Netherlands. The 25.000 Germans living in the Netherlands were branded as "hostile subjects", they were to be evicted in three groups in reverse order of entry. The first who had to leave were those who came after the start of the first world war (mostly factory workers), then those who came after 1932 (including political refugees, some of them Jews), and then the rest, many of whom were economic refugees from the 1920s. The operation started on 11 September 1946 in Amsterdam, where Germans and their families were taken from their homes in the middle of the night and given one hour to collect fifty kilograms of luggage. They were allowed to take one hundred Guilders, the rest of their possessions went to the state. They were taken to internment camps near the German border, the biggest of which was Mariënbosch near Nijmegen, from which they were evicted to the Britsch Zone of Occupation. With these newcomers being a burden on western germany, the British troops in Germany reacted by evicting the 100,000 Dutch citizens living near the border to the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8006707_DESC;The 1953 North Sea flood was a major flood caused by a heavy storm that occurred on the night of 31 January 1953 and morning of 1 February 1953. A combination of a high spring tide and a severe European windstorm over the North Sea caused a storm tide, the combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure led to a water level of more than 5.6 metres above mean sea level in some locations. The flood and waves overwhelmed sea defences and caused extensive flooding. The Netherlands, a country with 20% of its territory below mean sea level and 50% less than 1 metre above sea level and which relies heavily on sea defences, was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage. Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of Zeeland. In England, 307 people were killed in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Nineteen were killed in Scotland. Twenty-eight people were killed in West Flanders, Belgium. In addition, more than 230 deaths occurred on water craft along Northern European coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8006708_NAME;Depillarisation of our society;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_8006708_DESC;Pillarisation is the politico-denominational segregation of a society. These societies were (and in some areas, still are) "vertically" divided into several segments or "pillars" according to different religions or ideologies. The best-known examples of this are the Dutch and Belgian ones. These pillars all have their own social institutions: their own newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, Scouting organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology. This leads to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people from another pillar. During the 1960s the pillars largely broke down, particularly under political criticism from D66 and the group New Left in PvdA. Because of this and of increased mobility, many people could see that people from the other pillars were not that different from themselves. Increased wealth and education made people independent of many of the pillarised institutions, and young people did not want to be associated with these organisations anymore.;;;;;;;;;;X

The last stages of the freedom struggle from the 1920s onwards saw Congress adopt Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's policy of nonviolence and civil resistance, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's constitutional struggle for the rights of minorities in India, and several other campaigns. Legendary figures such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose later came to adopt a militant approach to the movement, while others like Swami Sahajanand Saraswati wanted both political and economic freedom for India's peasants and toiling masses. Poets including Rabindranath Tagore used literature, poetry and speech as a tool for political awareness. The period of the Second World War saw the peak of the campaigns by the Quit India movement (led by 'Mahatma' Gandhi) and the Indian National Army (INA) movement (led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose) and others, eventually resulting in the withdrawal of the British.;;;;;;;;;;X

As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment. Indian units served in Burma, where in 1944-45 five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East.

Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. But, much of that growth was offset by the fact that the external aid promised never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy.

The Border Campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the 1940s, when the harsh security measures of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland governments had severely weakened the IRA. IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan set out to create 'a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade'. By the middle of this decade the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. The plan for the Border Campaign  codenamed ""Operation Harvest""  was devised by Seán Cronin. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called flying columns, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA stated that the aim of the campaign was to: 'break down the enemy’s administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces.';;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8007433_DESC;During years of Border Campaign, the Republic’s government, feared that the IRA’s action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain and in January 1957, it used the Offences Against the State Act to arrest most of the IRA’s leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Seán Cronin. Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes, while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. Historically, the new government proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. Then in November 1961 his Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey established military courts which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8007451_DESC;The partition of Ireland (Irish: críochdheighilt na hÉireann) was the division of the island of Ireland into two distinct territories, Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, and the now Republic of Ireland, an independent state. Partition occurred when the British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 creating Northern Ireland and what was then Southern Ireland. From 1801 to 1920 the whole island had formed a constituent country of the United Kingdom. Before then it was the separate Kingdom of Ireland. The Act of 1920 was intended to create two self-governing territories within Ireland that remained within the UK. The Act also contained provisions for co-operation between the two territories and for the eventual reunification of Ireland. However, partition was reinforced in 1922 when what was intended to be Southern Ireland separated from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. Since partition began, a key aspiration of Irish nationalists has been to bring about a united Ireland, with the whole island forming one independent state. This goal conflicted with that of unionists in Northern Ireland, whose objective is to remain part of the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X

In the air, while Iranian fighter pilots had superior training compared to their Iraqi counterparts, and would continue to dominate in combat, due to shortages of aircraft, the size of defended territory and American intelligence supplied to Iraq, the Iraqis could exploit gaps in Iranian airspace.

In order for the cartel to maintain its desired price of $18 a barrel, discipline was required. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran–Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal. The result was a slump in the oil price – as low as $10 a barrel – with a resulting loss of $7 billion a year to Iraq, equal to its 1989 balance of payments deficit. In early July 1990, Iraq complained about Kuwait's behavior, such as not respecting their quota, and openly threatened to take military action.;;;;;;;;;;X

Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran’s peasantry, a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class. Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns.;;;;;;;;;;X

It was believed that the 'silent majority' of Iranians were either apolitical and/or approved of the Shah's government and policies. The Shah began a 'carrot and stick' policy towards the protesters. While still banning street demonstrations, he attempted to address the protesters concerns and act in a conciliatory manner towards them.

The reaction of the protesters to Black Friday, a violent government reaction to mass prostest, spread beyond quickly throughout the country, manifesting in the form of strikes.

Amidst the rising wave of lawlessness and the threat of a Communist insurgency, Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 by virtue of Proclamation No. 1081. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics senators Benigno Aquino, Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose Diokno.

In October 1940 the NKVD, under its new chief Lavrenty Beria, started a new purge that initially hit the People's Commissariat of Ammunition, People's Commissariat of Aviation Industry, and People's Commissariat of Armaments. High-level officials admitted guilt, typically under torture, then testified against others. Victims were arrested on fabricated charges of anti-Soviet activity, sabotage, and spying.

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin called the conference in response to divergences among eastern European governments on whether or not to attend the Paris Conference on Marshall Aid in July 1947. The initial seat of Cominform was located in Belgrade (then the capital of the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia). After the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the group in June 1948, the seat was moved to Bucharest, Romania.

The literal meaning of perestroika is 'restructuring', referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Perestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced some market-like reforms. The goal of the perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet consumers. The process of implementing perestroika arguably exacerbated already existing political, social and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and no doubt helped to further nationalism in the constituent republics.

EVT_8014242_DESC;Gorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production. By 1990 the government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies continued. Tax revenues declined because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralisation caused new production bottlenecks.;;;;;;;;;;X

The mutinies were suppressed, though survivors fled the towns and began an uncoordinated insurgency in rural areas. Poorly armed and ill-organized, they were little threat to the outgoing colonial power or the newly formed Sudanese government.

Bill financed a well-educated work force. The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. The U.S. underwent a kind of golden age of economic growth. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period—labor union membership peaked historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities—a process largely completed by 1960. Congress created the Council of Economic Advisors, to promote high employment, high profits and low inflation. The Eisenhower administration (19531961) supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession—accelerating public works programs, easing credit, and reducing taxes—were Arthur F. Burns and Neil H. Jacoby.

The Pu³awian faction - the name comes from the Pu³awska Street in Warsaw, on which many of the members lived - sought considerable liberalization of socialism in Poland.

The guerrilla warfare included an array of military attacks launched against the new communist prisons as well as MBP state security offices, detention facilities for political prisoners, and concentration camps set up across the country. Most of the Polish anti-communist groups ceased to exist in the late 1940s or 1950s, hunted down by MBP security services and NKVD assassination squads.

However, the presence of Soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country. On the contrary, it exacerbated a nationalistic feeling, causing the rebellion to spread further. Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan's new president, charged the Soviets with causing an increase in the unrest, and demanded that the 40th Army step in and quell the rebellion, as his own army had proved untrustworthy. Thus, Soviet troops found themselves drawn into fighting against urban uprisings, tribal armies (called lashkar), and sometimes against mutinying Afghan Army units.

USIA operated as a de-facto state corporation and controlled over four hundred expropriated Austrian factories, transportation and trading companies. USIA assets included formerly independent Austrian companies (ÖAF), factories once owned by German corporations (AEG) and former SS enterprises (DEST). At its peak in 1951 the conglomerate employed around 60 thousand people, or 10 percent of Austrian industrial labor. USIA was exempt from Austrian tariffs, disregarded Austrian taxation, and could easily trade with Eastern Europe despite the Iron Curtain and Western trade embargoes. The extraterritorial corporation attempted to be self-sufficient and was very weakly integrated with the rest of Austrian economy.;;;;;;;;;;X

The second set of trials of lesser war criminals was conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunals;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8204084_DESC;Among the secrets of postwar period in Germany was a coalition of approximately 2,000 former officers - veterans of the Nazi-era Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS - who decided to put together an army in 1949. They made their preparations without a mandate from the German government, without the knowledge of the parliament and, the documents show, by circumventing Allied occupation forces. The goal of the retired officers: to defend nascent West Germany against Eastern aggression in the early stages of the Cold War and, on the domestic front, deploy against the Communists in the event of a civil war. It collected information about left-wing politicians and spied on students. Everything was well hidden under the guise of an 'insurance company'.;;;;;;;;;;X

He concluded that 'even the most convinced reactionaries' had to recognize the justness of the Soviet resolution, and he vowed that the Soviet Union would not be bound by any decisions made by the Security Council if the Nationalist Chinese representative remained.

EVT_8226031_DESC;The city of Leningrad saw what is regarded as one of the greatest human tragedies of the entire War. Leningrad, one of the cities with a large amount of classical and baroque architecture on the Baltic Sea, was a city with a pre-war population of three million inhabitants. By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city's southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus North-West of the city. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad's only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad in order to starve the city to death. Soon, electricity, water and heating for civilian housing had to be shut down.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_8226032_DESC;The defence of Stalingrad from July to November 1942, the counter-offensive of 19 November 1942 that trapped the Axis forces in and around the ruined city, and the German surrender on 2 February 1943 marked the turning-point of the European Theatre of World War II. The intensity and sheer scale of the battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city's weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga, and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat. The total casualties on both sides are estimated at nearly 2 million, within a period of 200 days.;;;;;;;;;;X

German and Romanian troops had advanced to the outskirts of the city from the North and launched their attack on 30 October 1941. Having failed to take the city, Axis forces began a siege and heavy bombardment, with such unusual pieces of ordnance as the Mörser Karl self-propelled mortar, and the gigantic Schwerer Gustav railroad cannon. A second Axis offensive against the city, launched in December 1941, failed as well, as the Soviet army and navy forces continued to fight fiercely. Eventually the city was taken in June 1942.

The advance of the German Army Group Centre came to a halt in late November 1941, at the outskirts of Moscow itself. The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. Struggling between determination and despair, the city's population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids. General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city's defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city's approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on 5 and 6 December 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on 7 January 1942.

When the Germans commenced their offensive on 7 July, Soviet forces concentrated in the Kiev area were ordered to stand fast, and a breakout was prohibited. Defence of the pocket was fierce. Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kiev was taken on 19 September. Over 600,000 Soviet troops were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of blitzkrieg. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets. It had a huge effect on morale, and Adolf Hitler praised the victory as the greatest battle in history.;;;;;;;;;;X

In May 1942 the Germans occupied the city again, yet Soviet partisan forces held out in the cliffs near the city until October 1942. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing was launched.

It was the only Soviet port on the Northern coast that did not freeze in the winter, and was vital for the transport of supplies to the South. German forces, including 800 Finns under German command, launched an offensive against Murmansk on 29 June 1941. More than 180,000 grenades and inflammable shells were fired on the city itself. Fierce Soviet resistance in the tundra and several Soviet counter-attacks made an Axis breakthrough impossible, however.

German armoured divisions of Army Group Centre began an offensive on July 10, 1941 to encircle Soviet forces in the Smolensk area. Soviet resistance was strong, and several counter-attacks were conducted. The Soviets even managed to temporarily break the German encirclement and to evacuate troops out of the pocket.

In October 1941, the Communist Party and governmental organizations, diplomatic missions of foreign countries, leading cultural establishments and their staff were evacuated to the city. A dug-out for Joseph Stalin known as ""Stalin's Bunker"" was constructed but never used. As a leading industrial center, Kuybyshev played a major role in arming the country. From the very first months of World War II the city supplied the front with aircraft, firearms, and ammunition. The famous military parade of November 7, 1941 was held on the central square of the city. On March 5, 1942, Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony was first performed in the city's Opera and Ballet House by the Bolshoi Theater Orchestra conducted by S. A. Samosud. The symphony was broadcast all over the world. Health centers and most of the city's hospital facilities were turned into base hospitals.

In January 1946, Vietnam had its first National Assembly election (won by the Viet Minh in central and northern Vietnam), which drafted the first constitution, but the French tried to regain power by force. An accord between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was made 6 March 1946 but difference of viewpoints made it difficult to work together for the benefit of Vietnam. It was clear that the war between Viet Minh forces and France will break soon. Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam, within the French Union, with Emperor Bao Dai as Head of State.;;;;;;;;;;X

Roosevelt and General Joseph Stilwell privately made it adamantly clear that the French were not to reacquire French Indochina after the war was over.

They had been sent by Chiang Kai-shek under General Lu Han to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces occupying that area which had been designated to Chiang Kai-Shek. The Chinese forces initially kept the French Colonial soldiers interned with the acquiescence of the Americans. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement, and in February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges. This was done in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region but if Chinese insisted on coercing Indochina into their sphere of influence, they would be very hard to stop.;;;;;;;;;;X

Then the U.S. government gradually began supporting the French in their war effort, primarily through Mutual Defense Assistance Act, as a means of stabilizing the French Fourth Republic in which the French Communist Party was a significant political force. A dramatic shift occurred in American policy after the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. After the MochMarshall meeting of September 23, 1950, in Washington, the United States started to support the French Union effort politically, logistically and financially.

In the latest days of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 652 non-paratrooper soldiers from all army corps from cavalry to infantry to artillery dropped for the first and last time of their life to support their comrades.

EVT_8228030_DESC;Throughout the war theater, the Viet Minh cut French supply lines and began to seriously wear down the resolve of the French forces. There were continued raids, skirmishes and guerrilla attacks, but through most of the rest of the year each side withdrew to prepare itself for larger operations. The Battle of Na San saw the first use of the French commanders 'hedgehog' tactics consisting in setting up a well defended outpost to get the Viet Minh out of the jungle and force it to fight a conventional battle instead of ambushes. In late November and early December 1952, Giap attacked the French outpost at Na San, which was essentially an 'air-land base', a fortified camp supplied only by air. Giap's forces were beaten back repeatedly with very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Giap into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Na San convinced the French of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.;;;;;;;;;;X

In 1961, U.S. advisors in South Vietnam, along with the Diem regime, began the implementation of a plan attempted to isolate rural peasants from contact with and influence by the National Liberation Front (NLF). The Strategic Hamlet Program, along with its predecessor, the Rural Community Development Program, played an important role in the shaping of events in South Vietnam during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Both of these programs attempted to separate rural peasants from Communist insurgents by creating communities that in some ways resembled concentration camps. The program led to a decrease in support for Diem’s regime and an increase in sympathy for Communist efforts. By the end of 1963, 12000 of the 17000 strategic hamlets had been dismantled, liberating 5 million people (out of a total population of 14 million at that time).;;;;;;;;;;X

Arms, supplies, and troops came from North Vietnam into South Vietnam via a system of trails, named the Ho Chi Minh trail, that branched into Laos and Cambodia before entering South Vietnam. At first, most foreign aid for North Vietnam came from China, as Le Duan distanced Vietnam from the ""revisionist"" policy of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev.

There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 north of the McMahon Line, to which India claimed sovereignty.

Much related equipment was moved too, the aim being to virtually transplant research and production centres, such as the relocated V-2 rocket centre at Mittelwerk Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union. The codename 'Osoaviakhim' was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamed DOSAAF. The operation was commanded by NKVD deputy Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the local Soviet Military Administration (which in a few cases, such as Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone). The operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings. Whilst those removed were offered generous contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers, which in post-war Germany was seen as a gain), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.;;;;;;;;;;X

On 18 June, de Gaulle delivered a famous radio address via the BBC Radio service. De Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June exhorted the French people not to be demoralised and to continue to resist the occupation of France and work against the collaborationist Vichy regime, which had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany. Although the original speech could only be heard in a few parts of occupied France, de Gaulle's subsequent ones reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave De Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque would be transferred from North Africa to England to carry out that liberation. Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the Free French Forces and 'grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance';;;;;;;;;;X

By 1938 however, the enormous influence Hitler now had over Mussolini became clear with the introduction of the Manifesto of Race by Mussolini, adopting similar racial overtones.

CPUSA, claiming proletarian internationalism (while the U.S. Government called it espionage), sponsored an elaborate intelligence network on behalf of the Soviet Union, involving over 500 members acting as agents.The sections of the CP's International Workers Order meanwhile organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines, providing mutual aid and tailored cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200,000 at its height.;;;;;;;;;;X

In the first decades of the 20th century, it drew significant support from many different groups, including trade unionists, progressive social reformers, populist farmers, and immigrant communities.

Berger and Meyer London), dozens of state legislators, more than a hundred mayors, and countless lesser officials. The party's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I, although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression and vigilante persecution.

Along with the Suez crisis, the United States was also dealing with the near-simultaneous Hungarian revolution. Vice-President Richard Nixon later explained: "We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against Nasser". Beyond that, it was Eisenhower's belief that if the United States were seen to acquiesce in the attack on Egypt, that the resulting backlash in the Arab world might win the Arabs over to the Soviet Union. On 30 October, the Security Council held a meeting, at the request of the United States, when it submitted a draft resolution calling upon Israel immediately to withdraw its armed forces behind the established armistice lines.

However, the US secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, did not accommodate this attempt to achieve such a treaty. A final peace settlement has never been achieved.

The Western Allies were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals  military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, and the creation of a world peace organization  were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X

Comecon countries had also provided technical and economic training for personnel in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. When Comecon initially lent support to developing countries, it generally concentrated on developing those products that would support the domestic economies of the Third World, including replacements for imports. In the 1970s and 1980s, assistance from Comecon had been directed toward export-oriented industries. Third World countries had paid for this support with products, produced by the project for which Comecon rendered help. This policy had provided Comecon with a stable source of necessary deliveries, in addition to political influence in these strategically important areas.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_15611_DESC;The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a post World War II loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946.The loan was made primarily to cover liability incurred by Britain in the war to the US, as well as support British overseas expenditure in the immediate post-war years and not to implement the Labour government's welfare reforms. British treasury officials believed they could implement the Labour government's domestic reforms without the loan if Britain withdrew from all major overseas commitments. The loan was made subject to conditions, the most damaging of which was the convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949;;;;;;;;;;X

It was a decisive victory for the Croatian Army (HV), which attacked across a 630-kilometre (390 mi) front against the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and a strategic victory of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). The HV was supported by the Croatian special police advancing from the Velebit Mountain, and the ARBiH located in the Bihac pocket, in the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) rear. The battle, launched to restore Croatian control of 10,400 square kilometres (4,000 square miles) of territory, representing 18.4% of the country, and Bosnian control of Western Bosnia, was the largest European land battle since the Second World War. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was launched from the area of Bihac on 13 September 1995, against the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske  VRS), and involved advances towards Bosanski Petrovac, Sanski Most and Bosanska Krupa. At the same time, the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska  HV) and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijece obrane  HVO) were engaging the VRS in Operation Maestral 2 further to the southeast. After an initial 70-kilometre (43 mi) advance, VRS reinforcements managed to stop the ARBiH short of Sanski Most and Novi Grad, and reversed some of the ARBiH's territorial gains in a counterattack. After a part of the ARBiH 5th Corps was threatened with defeat around the town of Kljuc, the ARBiH requested assistance from the HV.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states.

There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of stare decisis, and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes. The rules of evidence in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony. Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim.

EVT_15300_DESC;Originally founded in 1862 as a Czech gymnastics movement in Prague, the Sokol movement soon spread further to other Slavic countries. While in theory a non-partisan organisation, the Sokol movement was in practice an important vehicle for the furthering of Czech nationalism and, later on, pan-slavic thought and ideology. The movement aimed to provide its members with comprehensive training of both mind and body, and its locales often acted as important forums for the dissemination of radical nationalist thought, for which it was several times suppressed by authorities.;Fondée à l'origine en 1862 comme un mouvement de gymnastique tchèque à Prague, le mouvement Sokol rapidement se propage à d'autres pays slaves. En théorie, organisation non partisane, le mouvement Sokol a été dans la pratique, un moyen important pour l'approfondissement du nationalisme tchèque et, plus tard, la pensée pan-slave et son idéologie. Le mouvement visait à fournir à ses membres une formation complète à la fois l'esprit et le corps, et ses cercles souvent agissaient comme des forums importants pour la diffusion de la pensée nationaliste radical, pour lequel le mouvement a été plusieurs fois supprimé par les autorités. ;Die ursprünglich im Jahr 1862 in Prag als tschechische Turnbewegung gegründete Bewegung breitete sich schon bald auf andere slawische Länder aus. Während es sich bei der Sokol-Bewegung theoretisch um eine unparteiische Organisation handelte, war sie tatsächlich ein wichtiges Medium zur Förderung des tschechischen Nationalismus und später panslawischer Gedanken und Ideologien. Die Bewegung hatte das Ziel, ihre Mitglieder geistig wie körperlich umfassend auszubilden.

EVT_22602_NAME;Total Fertility Rate;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_22602_DESC;In demography, demographic transition is a phenomenon and theory which refers to the historical shift from high birth rates and high infant death rates in societies with minimal technology, education (especially of women) and economic development, to low birth rates and low death rates in societies with advanced technology, education and economic development, as well as the stages between these two scenarios. Although this shift has occurred in many industrialised countries, the theory and model are frequently imprecise when applied to individual countries due to specific social, political and economic factors affecting particular populations. Scholars debate whether industrialisation and higher incomes lead to lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialisation and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher per capita income, lower mortality, old-age security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.;;;;;;;;;x

Boys and girls attend separate schools and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18. A significant proportion of young men remain in yeshiva until their marriage. After marriage, many Haredi men continue their Torah studies in a kollel. Studying in secular institutions is discouraged, although educational facilities for vocational training in a Haredi framework do exist. In the United States and Europe, the majority of Haredi males are active in the workforce. For various reasons, in Israel, around half of their members do not work, and most of those who do are not officially a part of the workforce.Families are usually large, reflecting adherence to the biblical commandment "Be fruitful and multiply".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_22613_DESC;Having children, raising them, and socialization with neighbors and relatives are the greatest functions of the Amish family. Amish believe large families are a blessing from God. Two key concepts for understanding Old Order Mennonite practices are their rejection of Hochmut (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) and the high value they place on Demut (humility) and Gelassenheit (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as "submission" or "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Old Order Mennonite's willingness to submit to the "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Old Order Mennonite anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community.

EVT_8000700_DESC;In early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994. The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft. According to "Moscow Echo" radio poll, Khodorkovsky would gain 38% of votes in presidential elections, Putin - 14%. He refused to stop financing oppositional parties Yabloko, Union of Right Forces and the Communist Party when Putin demanded it from him. He was the richest person in the country at the moment. On the morning of 25 October 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at the Novosibirsk airport. He was taken to Moscow and charged with fraud, tax evasion, and other economic crimes. Gessen describes the trial as a “travesty” and “a Kafka-esque procedure,” with the government spending months “on an incoherent account of alleged violations that were criminalized after they were committed, or that were in fact legal activities.” In preparing the case, the government called in Yukos employees for questioning. Pavel Ivlev, a tax lawyer who went along as their attorney, later explained that officials had illegally interrogated him and threatened to arrest him. After leaving the prosecutor’s office, he immediately flew out of the country. He and his family ended up settling in the U.S.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control... and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence.

EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all... now on our terms, rather than on theirs.

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-- one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin.

First described in April 2009, the virus appeared to be a new strain of H1N1 which resulted when a previous triple reassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus, leading to the term "swine flu". Unlike most strains of influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60 years; this was an unusual and characteristic feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even in the case of previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.;La définition du symptôme du choléra est une diarrhée, ce qui rend le malade presque totalement incapable de rétention de fluide.

EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge-- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The Chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces.

EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority.

Her forehead feels warm like an oven, and she cringes restlessly back and forth, her motions dull from exhaustion. Even with all the proper cleansing rituals and potions tried, our doctors have been unable to help her.

EVTDESC14100;Local $STATE$ administration has come under criticism for several instances of government subsidies directed at supporting local industry.

EVTDESC141001;A teenage girl was found beaten and raped in a cultural minority's section of a city in $STATENAME$. Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation.

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that this is, in fact, not the case, and, effectively, that the property rights of slave-owners are protected regardless of where in the Union the slave resides.

EVTDESC16110;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' -- The Declaration of Independence, 1776\n\nThe dank locale is dimly lit, and reeks of sweat and unwashed bodies. Cramped walls, littered with chains and ropes, tell tales of the trade that goes on in this auction house. One by one, blacks are shoved unto a small stage to stand, their hands tied, while the auctioneer calls out the bids. Here, human beings are herded like cattle to be sold into involuntary servitude, serfdom, and slavery.;Nous tenons ces vérités comme évidentes, que tous les les hommes naissent égaux, qu'ils sont dotés par leur Créateur de certains droits inaliénables, parmi lesquels la vie, la liberté et la recherche du bonheur. \n-- La Déclaration d'indépendance de 1776 -- \n\nLe local humide est faiblement éclairé, avec des relents de sueur et de corps non lavés. Murs étroits, parsemés de chaînes, témoins du commerce qui se passe en cette maison d'enchères. Un par un, les Noirs sont poussés vers une petite scène, se tenant debout, les mains liés, tandis que le commissaire-priseur crie les offres. Ici, les êtres humains sont entassés comme du bétail destinés à être vendus dans l'asservissement, le servage et l'esclavage. ;Wir erachten diese Wahrheiten, dass alle Menschen vor dem Schöpfer gleich sind und von ihm mit denselben unveräußerlichen Rechten ausgestattet wurden, zu denen Leben, Freiheit und das Streben nach Glück gehören, als selbstverständlich.' -- Die Unabhängigkeitserklärung, 1776\n\nDer nasskalte Raum ist kaum beleuchtet und stinkt nach Schweiß und ungewaschenen Körpern. Beengende Wände voller Ketten und Stricke künden von den Geschäften, die in diesem Auktionshaus getätigt werden. Einer nach dem anderen werden Schwarze mit gefesselten Händen auf eine kleine Bühne geschubst, während die Versteigerer die Angebote ausrufen. Hier werden menschliche Wesen wie Rinder zusammengetrieben und gegen ihren Willen als Sklaven verkauft.;;Sostenemos como evidentes por sí mismas dichas verdades: que todos los hombres son creados iguales, que son dotados por su creador de ciertos derechos inalienables, que entre estos están la vida, la libertad y la búsqueda de la felicidad. -- La Declaración de Independencia, 1776\n\nEl húmedo local apenas está iluminado, y apesta a sudor y cuerpos sin lavar. Las paredes atestadas de cadenas y cuerdas, nos hablan del tipo de comercio que tiene lugar en esta casa de subastas. Uno por uno, los negros son empujados a un pequeño estrado, donde permanecen, maniatados, mientras el subastador grita las pujas. Aquí, los seres humanos son tratados como ganado para ser vendidos a un involuntario vasallaje, a la servidumbre, y a la esclavitud.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16150;The 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern United States who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in $PROVINCENAME$. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending southern sentiments.;Les «Copperheads» étaient un groupe de démocrates dans les États du Nord qui, pendant la guerre civile, s'opposait à celle-ci, et favorisait un règlement de paix avec le Sud. Ce surnom était originaire des Unionistes les assimilant à des serpents venimeux, mais ils ont vite frappé à la maison des Copperheads eux-mêmes. Bien qu'il n'y ait pas de guerre encore, il y a une résistance farouche à l'abolitionnisme dans certains milieux démocratiques en $PROVINCENAME$. L'intensification de la campagne politique local pourrait sans doute les neutraliser, mais uniquement au prix d'une offense aux sentiments sudistes. ;Die 'Copperheads' waren eine Gruppe von Demokraten in den Nordstaaten der USA, die während des Kriegs einen Friedensschluss mit dem Süden befürworteten.

El mote les vino de los unionistas comparados con las serpientes venenosas, pero pronto quedó vinculado a los propios 'Copperheads'.

EVTDESC16160;Founded by W.L. Garrison in 1831, The Liberator was one of the most famous abolitionist newspapers in the United States before the Civil War.

The Liberator has just published another issue, and the slavery debate has further intensified.;Fondée par W.L.

EVTDESC16170;Slave Power was a term used to describe the political power of the landed, slave-owning 'aristocrats' of the Southern USA. Many Northern politicians saw slavery first and foremost not as an issue of mistreatment of blacks, but as something profoundly opposed and contrarian to the republican ideals laid out in the founding documents of the United States, and, thus, a threat more to the nation's civic virtues than to anything else. Today the Southern senators blocked a bill in the House of Representatives. While in itself unimportant, the blocking of the bill has revealed the strength of the Southern states in American politics.;«Slave Power» est un terme utilisé pour décrire le puissance politique des aristocrates esclavagistes des Etats du Sud. Beaucoup d'hommes politiques du Nord ont vu l'esclavage d'abord et avant tout non pas comme une question de mauvais traitements infligés aux Noirs, mais comme quelque chose de profondément opposé et anticonformiste aux idéaux républicains énoncés dans les documents fondateurs des États-Unis, et, par conséquent, une menace plus aux vertus civiques de la nation qu'à toute autre chose. Aujourd'hui, les sénateurs du Sud ont bloqué un projet de loi à la Chambre des représentants. Bien que de peu d'importance en lui-même, le blocage du projet de loi a révélé le force des États du Sud dans la politique américaine. ;Slave Power war der gebräuchliche Ausdruck zur Beschreibung der Macht der Sklaven haltenden, adligen Großgrundbesitzer der amerikanischen Südstaaten. Viele Politiker des Nordens sahen die Sklaverei in erster Linie nicht als eine Misshandlung der Schwarzen an, sondern als etwas, dass sich zutiefst gegen die republikanischen Ideale richtete, die in der Unabhängigkeitserklärung der Vereinigten Staaten formuliert worden waren. Deshalb stellte die Sklaverei vor allem eine Bedrohung der Bürgertugenden der Nation dar. Heute haben die Süd-Senatoren im Repräsentantenhaus einen Gesetzentwurf blockiert. Während der Gesetzentwurf selbst unwichtig ist, zeigt dessen Blockade doch den Einfluss der Südstaaten auf die amerikanische Politik.;;El poder esclavo fue una expresión utilizada para describir al poder político de la 'aristocracia' rural poseedora de esclavos en los EE. UU. del sur. Muchos políticos del norte consideraban la esclavitud, ante todo y sobre todo, no como un problema de maltrato de los negros, sino como algo profundamente contrario y opuesto a los ideales republicanos presentados en los documentos fundacionales de los Estados Unidos y, por lo tanto, más como una amenaza a las virtudes cívicas de la nación que a ninguna otra cosa. Hoy, los senadores sureños han bloqueado una ley en la Cámara de Representantes. Aunque en sí mismo carece de importancia, el bloqueo de la ley ha revelado la fuerza de los estados sureños en la política norteamericana.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Union as slave-states.

EVTDESC16415;The Ku Klux Klan, abbreviated 'The KKK', was a decentralized organization primarily composed of white southerners, formed in 1865 by Confederate war veterans from Tennessee. A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant. Today we received news that burning crosses have been seen, blazing against the warm, dark night skies of the South.;Le Ku Klux Klan, abrégé sous la forme KKK, était une organisation décentralisée principalement composée de sudistes blancs et formée en 1865 par les vétérans de guerre des Confédérés du Tennessee. Milice secrète, dont les membres étaient connus pour symboliquement brûler des croix vêtus de leurs toges et cagoules blanches, le KKK fut créé pour s'opposer à la Reconstruction républicaine dans le but de préserver la suprématie blanche dans les anciens États confédérés. Pour parvenir à ses fins, le KKK avait recours à la violence, une violence principalement dirigée contre les républicains du Sud et les noirs. Le KKK fut démantelé par le gouvernement fédéral lors de la promulgation des "Force Acts" de 1871, lors du premier mandant d'Ulyssess S. Grant. Aujourd'hui, nous avons appris que des croix en feu avaient été vues en pleine nuit dans le Sud.;Der Ku Klux Klan, abgekürzt mit 'The KKK', war im Jahr 1865 von konföderierten Kriegsveteranen in Tennessee gegründete, dezentrale Organisation, die sich hauptsächlich aus weißen Südstaatlern zusammensetzte. Diese geheime Bürgerwehr, die für ihren ikonischen Symbolismus mit brennenden Kreuzen und ihre weißen Kapuzen und Roben bekannt war, formierte sich als Opposition der Grundsätze des republikanischen Wiederaufbau und war der Wahrung der weißen Vorherrschaft in den Staaten der ehemaligen Konföderation verschrieben. Dem Klan waren zur Erreichung seines Ziels jede Mittel recht, und gegen Republikaner und Schwarze gerichtete Gewalt war eher die Regel als eine Ausnahme. Der Klan wurde während der ersten Amtszeit von Präsident Ulyssess S. Grant von der Föderationsregierung durch die Verabschiedung des Force Acts von 1871 unterdrückt. Heute haben wir die Nachricht erhalten, dass man im Süden Kreuze gesehen hat, die unter dem warmem Nachthimmel loderten.;;El Ku Klux Klan, abreviado 'El KKK', fue una organización descentralizada compuesta principalmente de hombres de raza blanca sureños, formada en 1865 por veteranos del ejército confederado de Tennessee. Se trataba de un grupo de vigilancia secreto, conocido por su símbolo icónico de la cruz en llamas y por ir ataviados con túnicas y capuchas blancas. El KKK se formó en oposición a los principios de la Reconstrucción republicana. El grupo se dedicaba a preservar la supremacía de la raza blanca en los antiguos estados confederados. El Klan utilizaba todos los métodos a su alcance para cumplir su objetivo, por lo que eran habituales sus actos de violencia dirigidos hacia los republicanos del sur y los hombres de raza negra. El Klan fue disuelto por el Gobierno Federal a través del Acta de Derechos Civiles de 1871, durante el primer mandato de gobierno de Ulyssess S. Grant. Hoy hemos recibido la noticia de que se han visto cruces ardiendo en los oscuros cielos de las cálidas noches sureñas.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Obwohl es in Zukunft sicherlich zu Gefechten zwischen den Stämmen und uns kommen wird, ist die scharfe Klinge der Sioux-Nation nun deutlich stumpfer. Die Sioux werden niemals wieder in der Lage sein, eine auch nur ansatzweise vergleichbare Streitmacht aufzustellen - die Zukunft der Sioux-Nation liegt in den Reservaten. Dass diese einst stolze Nation nun nur noch in unseren Geschichtsbüchern weiterleben wird, stimmt uns traurig.;;Toro Sentado y sus bravos se han rendido, y los sioux han sido derrotados. Aunque tendrán lugar más batallas entre las tribus y nosotros, el filo de la nación sioux ya ha quedado despuntado. Los sioux no podrán volver a reunir una fuerza de tamaño comparable nunca más, y el futuro de la nación sioux estará supeditado a las reservas.

EVTDESC17060;Suffragettes, picketing a local bar in one of our provinces, are becoming the laughing stock of the entire state. The sight of the two, relatively frail, upper class women, standing with their placards outside the bar, picketing for Woman's Suffrage and temperance, is not only being made into an object of ridicule, it is also causing some anger among the lower classes, who feel that the well-offs, the high-and-mighties and the holier-than-thous are trying to patronize (or matronize, as the case may be) them with sophistry and rhetoric.;Les suffragettes, en piquet de grève dans un bar local d'une de nos provinces, sont la risée de tout l'État. La vue de deux femmes, relativement frêles et issues des classes supérieures, arborant leurs pancartes pour le droit de vote des femmes et la modération à l'extérieur du bar, en plus d'être ridicule, suscite la colère des classes inférieures qui estiment que ces nanties tentent là de les patronner à grand renfort de sophistique et de rhétorique.;Frauenrechtlerinnen, die eine lokale Bar in einer unserer Provinzen bestreiken, haben sich im ganzen Staat zur Lachnummer gemacht. Der Auftritt zweier zierlicher Frauen, die mit ihren Plakaten vor der Bar stehen und für Frauenwahlrecht und Mäßigung demonstrieren, wird nicht nur öffentlich verspottet, sondern sorgt auch in der Unterschicht für einigen Ärger. Deren Angehörige finden, dass die Besserverdienenden und selbstgefälligen Mächtigen versuchen, sie von oben herab mit Spitzfindigkeit und Rhetorik zu belehren.;;Las sufragistas, que han organizado un piquete en un bar local de una de nuestras provincias, se han convertido en el hazmerreír de todo el estado. La visión de dos frágiles mujeres de clase alta, situadas fuera del bar con sus pancartas, haciendo un piquete por el sufragio femenino y el movimiento antialcohólico, no solo se ha convertido en objeto de burlas, sin que también está generando malestar entre las clases bajas, que sienten que la gente de buena cuna, los altos y poderosos y las personas de bien se comportan con ellos de forma paternalista (o mejor dicho en este caso, maternalista) de una forma sutil y retórica.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17070;Like many nascent political ideologies, the early suffragette movements were not foreign to in-fighting and organizational splits over issues of tactics and perceived ideological differences, the split between the NUWSS and the NSWRV in Britain being a poignant example. The suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ is experiencing somewhat of a setback, on account of an organizational split. ;Comme bon nombre d'idéologies naissantes, les premiers mouvements des suffragettes n'échappaient pas aux divergences tactiques et différences idéologiques, comme en témoigne le poignant exemple de la scission entre le NUWSS et le NSWRV en Grande-Bretagne.

Die Frauenrechtsbewegung in $COUNTRY$ ist aufgrund einer organisatorischen Aufspaltung einen Rückschlag erlitten.;;Como muchas ideologías políticas emergentes, los primeros movimientos sufragistas no eran ajenos a las luchas internas y a las escisiones organizativas en lo referente a tácticas y percepción de las cuestiones ideológicas.

El movimiento sufragista en $COUNTRY$ está experimentando una cierta regresión debida a una división organizativa. ;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC17150;The (so-called) Cat and Mouse Act was an infamous British law passed in 1912 in order to combat the suffragette tactic of using hunger strikes as a means to build sympathy for the Suffragette cause. The law stated that a person could be released from jail to recover from any serious illness, only to be jailed again on recovery, thereby washing the government's hands of any harm caused to the woman in question by the hunger strike. A similar ordinance has found its way into the legislature of one of our states, where suffragette hunger strikes are handled in this exact same way.;La loi du chat et de la souris était une loi britannique impopulaire visant à contrecarrer la tactique des suffragettes qui avaient recours aux grèves de la faim pour rallier du soutien à leur cause. Cette loi stipulait qu'une personne pouvait être libérée de prison, pour se faire soigner, en cas de maladie grave et qu'une fois rétablie, elle était réemprisonnée et ce, pour permettre au gouvernement de se laver les mains de tout mauvais traitement infligé aux suffragettes. Une loi est en cours dans l'un de nos États pour assurer un traitement similaire aux grèves de la faim entreprises par les suffragettes.;Das (so genannte) Katz- und Mausgesetz war ein berüchtigtes britisches Gesetz, das im Jahr 1912 verabschiedet wurde, um der Hungerstreiktaktik zum Erheischen von Sympathie der Frauenrechtlerinnen entgegen zu wirken. Das Gesetz besagte, dass eine Person aus dem Gefängnis entlassen werden konnte, um sich von einer schweren Krankheit zu erholen ... nur um die Haft nach der Erholung fortzusetzen. Damit sprach sich die Regierung von aller Verantwortung für etwaige gesundheitlichen Schäden frei, die sich die fragliche Frau durch den Hungerstreik zuziehen konnte. Eine vergleichbare Verordnung hat sich in der Legislative einer unserer Staaten verankert, wo mit Hungerstreiks von Frauenrechtlerinnen auf exakt dieselbe Weise umgegangen wird.;;La así llamada 'Cat and Mouse Act' (acta del gato y el ratón) fue una infame ley británica promulgada en 1912 para contrarrestar la táctica de las sufragistas de iniciar huelgas de hambre a fin de conseguir simpatizantes para su causa.

Eso permitía al gobierno lavarse las manos de cualquier daño que sufriese la mujer que fuese producto de su huelga de hambre.

EVTDESC17690;The right-wing party in one of our states is in the process of rising up in open revolution, as news reach us today that they have set up headquarters in a local beer hall, and have read, from its stairs, a declaration of a takeover of state and government functions in the state. Our cabinet is divided on how to handle the situation, but there seems to be some consensus that the local police should be quite capable of handling the situation once they mobilize. Others argue that the revolt must be put down with every available means. Doing the latter risks building support for the right-wing cause among those already disgruntled with our rule.;Le parti fasciste d'un de nos États, fomente une révolution et nous avons appris, ce jour, qu'il a établi son siège dans une brasserie locale avant, du haut de l'escalier, de lire une déclaration de putsch contre l'État. Notre cabinet est divisé sur la manière de gérer la situation, mais il semble y avoir un consensus sur la capacité de la police à juguler la situation. D'autres soulignent la nécessité de mâter la révolte coûte que coûte. Mais une telle entreprise risquerait de permettre aux fascistes de rallier des mécontents à leur cause.;Die faschistische Partei in einem unserer Staaten schickt sich zur offenen Revolution an: Heute haben uns Nachrichten erreicht, dass sie in einem lokalen Bierkeller ihr Hauptquartier aufgeschlagen und von seiner Treppe aus eine Erklärung zur Übernahme der staatlichen Kontrolle verlesen haben. Unser Kabinett ist sich bezüglich des weiteren Vorgehens uneins, aber man scheint sich sicher zu sein, dass die lokale Polizei sehr wohl in der Lage sein dürfte, die Situation in den Griff zu bekommen, sobald sie zum Einsatz gebracht wird. Andere fordern, dass die Revolution mit allen verfügbaren Kräften niedergeschlagen werden muss. Mit Letzterem würden wir riskieren, jene, die mit unserer Herrschaft unzufrieden sind, den Faschisten in die Arme zu treiben.;;El partido fascista de uno de nuestros estados está en el proceso de iniciar una revolución abierta, ya que nos llegan noticias de que han organizado un cuartel general en una cervecería local y han leído, desde sus escaleras, una declaración de toma del poder del estado y de las funciones de gobierno en el mismo. Nuestro gabinete se divide en la forma de abordar la situación, pero parece haber consenso en que la policía local debería se capaz de manejar la situación en cuanto se movilice.

EVTDESC17700;The fascists in one of our states have organized an anti-socialist trade union, dedicated to promoting what it calls 'the organic relationship between labour and capital', under a more general corporativist umbrella. The union is directly subordinate to the right-wing party, and has reportedly already been able to scrounge up quite an impressive membership list. We can attempt to suppress this organization, but that risks driving workers to the socialist trade unions instead.;Les fascistes de l'un de nos États ont créé un syndicat antisocialiste avec pour vocation de promouvoir ce qu'ils appellent "les relations organiques entre travail et capital", sous couvert d'une organisation corporatiste plus générale. Ce syndicat, qui est à la solde du parti fasciste, a déjà réussi à enrôler un nombre impressionnant de membres. Nous pouvons tenter de le neutraliser, mais ce faisant, les ouvriers risquent de se tourner vers les syndicats socialistes.;Die Faschisten in einem unserer Staaten haben eine antisozialistische Gewerkschaft organisiert, die sich der Förderung der 'organischen Beziehungen zwischen Arbeitern und Kapital' in einem allgemeineren korporativistischen Rahmen verschrieben hat. Die Gewerkschaft ist eine direkte Suborganisation der faschistischen Partei und hat Berichten bereits eine ziemliche beeindruckende Mitgliederliste. Wir können die Unterdrückung dieser Organisation versuchen, aber das würde das Risiko tragen, dass sich die Arbeiter stattdessen den sozialistischen Gewerkschaften zuwenden.;;Los fascistas de uno de nuestros estados han organizado un sindicato antisocialista, dedicado a promover lo que denominan la relación orgánica entre el trabajo y el capital, bajo el amparo de un paraguas corporativista más general.

Podemos intentar suprimir esta organización, pero nos arriesgamos a que los trabajadores se dirijan a los sindicatos socialistas en su lugar.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society.

There are a thousand thirsty throats in $CAPITAL$ who just ordered a glass from these here casks.'\n\nProhibition has created a lucrative market in the gin running business. From neighboring countries, and from secret, underground breweries and distilleries everywhere, an army of unseen works around the clock to bring the public the finest choices of paint thinners, wood spirits and moonshine. Police have received news that a shipment of illegal alcohol will be entering one of our states tonight.;Silence les garçons, juste quelques secondes de plus. Une fois que la garde sera loin, nous nous faufilerons à travers la frontière.

Dans les provinces voisines, et en secret, les brasseries et distilleries envoyent une armée d'ouvriers invisibles travaillant nuit et jour pour offrir à tout un chacun le plus ample choix d'essences de bois et d'alcool frelaté. La police a reçu des nouvelles qu’un transfert d'alcool illégal serait entré hier soir dans une de nos provinces.;Ruhe, Jungs, nur noch ein paar Sekunden. Sobald der Wachmann da drüben wegschaut, schleichen wir über die Grenze. In $CAPITAL$ sind tausend durstige Kehlen, die gerade ein Glas aus diesen Fässern hier bestellt haben.'\n\nDie Prohibition hat den Ginschmuggel zu einem lukrativen Markt gemacht. In Nachbarländern und geheimen Untergrundbrauereien überall arbeitet eine Armee Unsichtbarer rund um die Uhr, um die Bevölkerung mit den besten Farbverdünnern, Holzbränden und Moonshine zu versorgen. Der Polizei ist zu Ohren gekommen, dass eine Ladung illegalen Alkohols heute Abend in einen unserer Staaten geliefert wird.;;Tranquilos, chicos. Solo unos segundos más. En cuanto el guardia mire hacia otro lado, nos colaremos por la frontera. En $CAPITAL$, hay mil gargantas secas que han pedido un trago de lo que hay en estos barriles.\n\nLa prohibición ha creado un lucrativo mercado en el negocio del contrabando de ginebra. Procedente de los países vecinos y de destilerías clandestinas secretas repartidas por todas partes, un ejército invisible trabaja incansable para llevar al público las mejores selecciones de disolventes, licores de madera y alcoholes de patata. La policía acaba de recibir el aviso de un envío de alcohol ilegal que entrará en nuestros estados esta noche.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18000;... and what, with the people desperately clamoring for reform and social justice, hunger riots and class struggle, has our party done to aid the cause of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ workers? Nothing, save the continual reassurance of the eventual fulfillment of vague promises! Colleagues, for these reasons, and many more, I, for one, can no longer consider myself a liberal, except in the true sense of the word: a socialist.'\n\nA block of radical members of the Upper House have defected to form a socialist block, agitating for social reform, equality and worker's solidarity. We could put pressure on the party group to maintain cohesion within its ranks.;... et qu'a donc fait le parti, avec les gens qui réclament désespérément des réformes, de la justice sociale, contre les émeutes de la faim et la lutte de classe, pour aider la cause des $COUNTRY_ADJ$ travailleurs ?

Chers collègues, pour ces raisons, et bien d'autres, pour ma part, je ne peux plus me considérer comme un libéral, sauf dans le vrai sens du mot : un socialiste. \n\nUn bloc de députés radicaux de la Chambre haute a fait défection pour former un sous-groupe socialiste, agissant pour des réformes sociales, l'égalité et la solidarité des travailleurs. Nous pourrions faire pression sur le groupe du parti pour maintenir la cohésion dans ses rangs. ;... und was hat unsere Partei angesichts des nach Reformen und sozialer Gerechtigkeit schreienden Volkes, den Hungerrevolten und dem Klassenkampf getan, um die Sache der $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Arbeiter zu unterstützen?

Meine lieben Kollegen, aus diesen und vielen anderen Gründen kann ich mich nicht mehr als Liberalen bezeichnen;;... con la gente demandando desesperadamente reforma y justicia social, con huelgas de hambre y lucha de clases, ¿qué ha hecho nuestro partido por ayudar a la causa de los trabajadores de $COUNTRY$? ¡Nada, excepto las continuas palabras tranquilizadoras del eventual cumplimiento de vagas promesas! Compañeros, por estas razones, y por mucha otras, yo, para empezar, no puedo seguir considerándome un liberal, excepto en el verdadero sentido de la palabra: un socialista.\n\nUn grupo de miembros radicales de la cámara alta se ha escindido para formar un bloque socialista, que hace campaña por la reforma social, la igualdad y la solidaridad obrera.

EVTDESC18010;Social democracy is democracy in name only. While the party still struggles to maintain illusions, it is long since abundantly evident to any sincere observer that it has come to leave the parliamentary order for a devolution into stale mass-action, rigid dogma and  nepotism. When the levee breaks, let the people know that some stood against the tide.'\n\nA clique of disgruntled within the Upper House have realigned themselves in opposition to socialist refusals to enact political reforms. By exerting political pressure, we can affect the make-up of this new opposition.;La social-démocratie est une démocratie que de nom. Bien que le parti se bat encore à maintenir des illusions, il est depuis longtemps clair pour tout observateur sincère qu'il est venu le moment de quitter l'ordre parlementaire qui fait un transfert en masse de mesures obsolètes, d'un dogme rigide et du népotisme. Quand le barrage cédera, que les gens sachent que certains se tenaient à contre-courant. \n\nUne clique de mécontents au sein de la Chambre haute s'est réaligné en opposition au refus socialiste d'adopter des réformes politiques. En exerçant une pression politique, nous pouvons influer sur la composition de cette nouvelle oppostion. ;Die Sozialdemokratie hat mit Demokratie nur auf dem Papier etwas am Hut. Während sich die Partei immer noch bemüht, Illusionen aufrecht zu erhalten, so kann ein genauer Beobachter schon seit längerer Zeit mehr als deutlich sehen, dass sie die parlamentarische Ordnung für eine Devolution zu altbackenen Massenaktionen, steifem Dogma und Nepotismus verlassen hat. Wenn der Damm bricht, sollen die Leute wissen, dass sich einige gegen die Flut gestellt haben.'\n\nEine Clique verärgerter Oberhausmitglieder hat sich an der Opposition ausgerichtet, um ihrer Gegnerschaft der sozialistischen Verweigerung politischer Reformen Ausdruck zu verleihen. Durch die Ausübung politischen Drucks können wir den Charakter dieser neuen Opposition beeinflussen.;;La social democracia solo es demócrata en el nombre. Mientras el partido sigue empeñándose en sostener espejismos, hace mucho que es evidente para cualquier analista honesto que se ha abandonado el orden parlamentario para derivar hacia unos principios trillados, los dogmas rígidos y el nepotismo. Cuando el dique se rompa, hagámosle saber a la gente que hay algo que se sostiene en pie frente a la ola.\n\nUna camarilla de descontentos en el seno de la cámara alta se ha reorganizado frente a las negativas socialistas de realizar reformas políticas. Ejerciendo presión política, podemos perjudicar a la formación de esta nueva oposición.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18020;... and, yet, it has been said by our self-professed conservatives that the lower classes are unfit -- on account of deficiencies in education, and moral and social understanding -- to have representation. I present to the chamber that this is nothing save base confusion over hen and egg. For if it were ordained by providence that these classes had long since been represented in this noble chamber, then, perhaps, those deficiencies might not still be left unmended to fester.'\n\nA rousing speech in the Upper House today has led to several defections to the liberal faction over the issue of charter reform. The public outcry for universal suffrage continues to grow.;... et, pourtant, il a été dit par nos auto-proclamés-conservateurs que les classes inférieures ne sont pas aptes -- en raison de carences dans l'éducation, et dans la compréhension morale et sociale  à avoir une représentation. Je présente à la chambre que ce n'est rien, sinon la confusion de base sur qui de la poule ou de l'oeuf. Car si cela fut ordonné par la providence alors ces classes auraient depuis longtemps été représentées dans cette noble chambre, alors, oui peut-être, ces lacunes pourraient ne pas toujours s'envenimer. \n\nUn discours enflammé à la Chambre haute a conduit aujourd'hui à plusieurs défections dans la faction libérale sur la question de la réforme de la Charte. Les protestations du public pour le suffrage universel continue de croître. ;... und trotzdem haben unsere selbst ernannten Konservativen behauptet, dass die Unterschicht aufgrund von Defiziten bei Bildung, Moral und sozialem Verständnis kein Repräsentationsrecht hat. Ich konfrontiere dieses Haus damit, dass es sich dabei um nichts anderes als eine groteske Fehleinschätzung handelt: Wenn es von der Vorhersehung bestimmt gewesen wäre, dass diese Klasse schon seit langem Vertreter in diesem noblen Haus hätte, dann würden diese Defizite vielleicht nicht immer noch unverbessert vor sich hin faulen.'\n\nEine stürmische Rede über die Charter-Reform im Oberhaus hat heute zu mehreren Parteiaustritten bei der liberalen Fraktion geführt. Der Schrei der Öffentlichkeit nach universeller Gleichberechtigung wird immer lauter.;;... e incluso nuestros autoproclamados conservadores han dicho que las clase más bajas no son aptas-- por culpa de las deficiencias educativas y en la comprensión moral y social -- para tener representación. Expongo ante la cámara que esto no es más que el viejo dilema del huevo y la gallina. Porque si se hubiera decretado por previsión que dichas clases tuvieran hace tiempo representación en esta noble cámara, entonces, quizá, tales deficiencias no seguirían siendo endémicas.\n\nHoy, un apasionado discurso en la cámara alta ha dado lugar a varias deserciones hacia el bando liberal por el tema de la reforma de la constitución.

EVTDESC18030;... so you see, my dear old friend, that we need your support in the Upper House in order for the motion to carry.'\n\nLiberals in the Upper House have been conducting a charm offensive, directed at 'swing voters' of the other parties, mustering support in the Upper House for a rescinding of the ban on public meetings. The campaign has met with some success, and we need to decide on what to do about it.;... donc, vous voyez, mon cher vieil ami, que nous avons besoin de votre soutien à la Chambre haute afin de porter la motion. \n\nLes libéraux à la Chambre haute ont mené une offensive de charme, visant les électeurs indécis des autres parties, pour recueillir du soutien à la Chambre haute permettant l'annulation de l'interdiction des réunions publiques. La campagne a rencontré un certain succès, et nous devons décider quoi faire à ce sujet. ;... also, mein alter Freund, jetzt seht Ihr, dass wir im Oberhaus Ihre Unterstützung benötigen, damit der Antrag angenommen wird.'\n\nLiberale haben im Oberhaus eine Charmoffensive gestartet, um Mitglieder der anderen Parteien zur Unterstützung eines Antrags zur Aufhebung des Verbots öffentlicher Versammlungen zu gewinnen. Die Kampagne hatte einigen Erfolg, und jetzt müssen wir uns entscheiden, ob wir einschreiten.;;... así que ya veis, queridos amigos, que necesitamos vuestro apoyo en la cámara alta para aprobar la moción.\n\nEn la cámara alta, los liberarles han estado llevando a cabo una campaña de adulación, dirigida a los 'indecisos' de los demás partidos, reuniendo apoyos en la cámara alta para revocar la prohibición sobre los mítines públicos.

EVTDESC18040;...I've seen the red banners on the streets of $CAPITAL$, and I believe that the only way to combat the rising tide of socialism is through a policy of accommodation.'\n\nA group of reform-minded liberals in the Upper House have decided to cast their lots with the socialist agenda with regards to the issue of trade-union reform. The group, claiming that our present policies allow public opinion too little sway, and arguing that labour reform is needed to protect worker's interests, is organizing to form a parliamentary block. Should we pull some strings in parliament to counter-act this move?;... J'ai vu les drapeaux rouges dans les rues de $CAPITAL$, et je crois que la seule façon de lutter contre la montée du socialisme passe par une politique du logement. \n\nUn groupe de réformateurs libéraux à la Chambre haute a décidé de batailler sur le programme socialiste en ce qui concerne la question des réformes syndicales. Affirmant que nos politiques actuelles permettent trop peu d'influencer l'opinion publique, et faisant valoir que la réforme du travail est nécessaire pour protéger les intérêts des travailleurs, le groupe s'est organisé pour former un sous-groupe parlementaire. Devrions-nous tirer quelques ficelles au parlement pour contrebalancer ce mouvement ?;...Ich habe die roten Spruchbänder auf den Straßen von $CAPITAL$ gesehen und bin der Ansicht, dass wir den aufkommenden Sozialismus nur mit politischen Zugeständnissen bekämpfen können.'\n\nEine Gruppe reformwilliger Liberaler im Oberhaus hat sich zur Reform der Gewerkschaften auf die Seite der sozialistischen Agenda geschlagen. Die Gruppe, die behauptet, dass unsere gegenwärtige Politik der öffentlichen Meinung zu wenig Spielraum gewähre und die Reformierung der Gewerkschaften zum Schutz der Interessen der Arbeiter fordert, formiert sich zur Bildung eines parlamentarischen Blocks. Sollen wir unsere Beziehungen im Parlament spielen lassen, um dies zu verhindern?;;... He visto las pancartas rojas en las calles de $CAPITAL$, y creo que la única manera de combatir la creciente ola de socialismo es a través de una política de adaptación.\n\nEn la cámara alta, un grupo de liberales de mentalidad reformista ha decidido probar suerte con la agenda socialista en lo referente a la reforma sindical. El grupo, aduciendo que nuestras actuales políticas apenas permiten influencia de la opinión pública, y proponiendo que es necesaria una reforma laboral para proteger los intereses de los trabajadores, se está organizando para formar un bloque parlamentario. ¿Deberíamos mover algunos hilos en el parlamento para contrarrestar este movimiento?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18050;... so it is now, with renewed force, that I restate that conundrum of mine which is yet to garner any sort of response from this chamber: What is to be done about the issue of the press reform? Me, and many colleagues with me, have long argued that the time for reform is now, yet this session has remained entirely unwilling to commit to even an answer, much less a policy.'\n\nReform-minded MPs in parliament have reformed in a new coalition to push the agenda for press reform. Capitalizing on popular sentiment for freedom of expression, the liberals are gaining strength in the Upper House.;... et c'est donc maintenant, avec une force renouvelée, que je reformule ce dilemme qui est le mien et qui est, pourtant, de recueillir toute sorte de réponse de cette chambre : qu'est-ce qui doit être fait à propos le question de la la réforme la presse ? Moi, et de nombreux collègues avec moi, ai longtemps soutenu que le temps de la réforme est venu, mais cette session reste entièrement réticente à s'engager pour même une réponse, et encore moins une politique.\n\nDes députés réformateurs au Parlement se sont regroupés dans une nouvelle coalition pour pousser l'ordre du jour de la réforme de la presse. Capitalisant sur le sentiment populaire pour la liberté d'expression, les libéraux gagnent du terrain à la Chambre haute. ;... und so bringe ich nun vor diesem Haus zum wiederholten Male die schwierige Frage auf, die immer noch irgendeiner Art von Reaktion ausharrt: Was soll hinsichtlich der Pressereform getan werden? Ich und viele meiner Kollegen sagen schon seit langer Zeit, dass jetzt die Zeit für Reformen gekommen ist, und dennoch ist diese Versammlung seit jeher vollkommen unwillig, eine Antwort zu geben, geschweige denn eine Gesetzesänderung zu veranlassen.'\n\nReformwillige Parlamentsabgeordnete haben eine Koalition gebildet, um die Pressereform-Agenda voranzubringen. Die Liberalen schlagen dabei Nutzen aus der öffentlichen Meinung zugunsten der freien Meinungsäußerung und stärken ihre Position im Oberhaus.;;... así que ahora, con fuerza renovada, es cuando yo repito aquel enigma mío que aún espera algún tipo de respuesta de esta cámara: ¿Qué se va a hacer con el asunto de la reforma de prensa? Yo, y mis compañeros conmigo, ya hemos abogado de sobras que el momento de la reforma es ahora, pero esta audiencia se ha mostrado totalmente reacia a ofrecer siquiera una respuesta, y mucho menos una política de acción.\n\nLos parlamentarios reformistas se han transformado en nueva coalición para presionar la agenda de la reforma de prensa.

EVTDESC18060;Which is why we have only a resounding 'No' to offer the propositions of further reforms! We came here with a platform of limited reform, but we now hear talk of reforms that threaten to overthrow every sacred and long established institution of this land, ultimately threatening to unravel the very fabric of our society.'\n\nDisgruntled by the prevailing political winds, an unholy alliance between members of several factions in the Upper House have coalesced into one block dedicated to opposing all further efforts at fundamentally reforming the political system.;… et c'est pourquoi nous avons seulement un «non» retentissant à offrir aux propositions de nouvelles réformes ! Nous sommes venus ici avec une base de réforme limitée, mais nous devons maintenant entendre parler de réformes qui menacent de renverser toutes les institutions sacrées et établies de longue date de cette terre, et en fin de compte menaçant de défaire le tissu même de notre société. \n\nContrarié par les les vents politiques dominants, une alliance contre nature entre les membres de plusieurs factions de la Chambre haute a fusionné en un seul groupe dédié à s'opposer à tous les nouveaux efforts de réforme fondamentale du système politique. ;Und aus diesem Grund haben wir die Forderungen nach weiteren Reformen entschieden abgelehnt! Wir haben uns hier auf der Basis beschränkter Reformen getroffen, nun aber werden Stimmen laut, die Reformen fordern, die jede heilige und seit langer Zeit bestehende Institution dieses Landes umstürzen und letztendlich das Gefüge unserer Gesellschaft aus den Angeln heben würden.'\n\nAufgrund ihrer Verärgerung über die derzeitige politische Situation sind mehrere Mitglieder verschiedener Fraktion des Oberhaus eine Allianz des Bösen eingegangen. Sie haben einen eigenen Block gebildet und wollen alle zukünftigen Versuche verhindern, das politische System grundlegend zu reformieren.;;¡Es por eso que solo podemos responder con un 'No' rotundo a las propuestas de más reformas! Nosotros vinimos con un programa de reformas limitado, pero ahora oímos hablar de reformas que amenazan con acabar con cualquier institución sagrada y sobradamente establecida de este territorio, amenazando en última instancia con desmadejar el mismísimo tejido de nuestra sociedad.\n\nDisgustados por los vientos políticos predominantes, en la cámara alta se ha formado una truculenta alianza entre miembros de diversas facciones conformando un solo bloque dedicado a oponerse a cualquier tentativa que signifique en la práctica una reforma del sistema político.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18070;...anyone opposed?'\n\nDuring a hastily called extraordinary session of the Upper House, a curious motion for constitutional reform has been passed.

Gegenstimmen?'\n\nWährend einer außerordentlichen Sitzung des Oberhauses wurde einem merkwürdigen Antrag zur Verfassungsreform stattgegeben. Der Antrag schlägt ein politisches System mit einem Oberhaus vor, dessen Abgeordnete von der Regierungspartei ernannt werden. Dies wirkt wie ein Putschversuch der reaktionären Regierungspartei.;;... ¿alguien en contra?\n\nDurante una sesión extraordinaria de la cámara alta, convocada a toda prisa, se ha aprobado una curiosa moción para la reforma constitucional.

EVTDESC18080;A debate on wage slavery has taken hold in the Upper House, and the socialist party is gaining traction by arguing the need for wage reform. The broad popular support for further social reforms has lead to several nominally non-socialist members of the house finding themselves increasingly pressed by their home constituencies to push for further reforms, causing some of them to consider crossing the aisle over to the socialist block. Through political maneuvering, we could probably avoid massive defections to the socialists, but this would probably be seen as an autocratic move by broad stratas of our country's population.;Un débat sur l'esclavage salarié s'est amorcé à la Chambre haute, et le parti socialiste gagne du terrain en faisant valoir la nécessité d'une réforme des salaires. Le large soutien populaire à la poursuite des réformes sociales a conduit plusieurs membres, théoriquement non-socialistes de la Chambre se trouvant de plus en plus pressés par leur circonscription, d'aller dans le sens de la poursuite des réformes, ce qui amène certains d'entre-eux à envisager de traverser l'allée pour rejoindre le banc socialiste. Grâce à des manœuvres politiques, nous pourrions sans doute éviter des défections massives pour les socialistes, mais ce serait probablement considéré comme un geste autocratique par de larges franges de la population de notre pays. ;Eine Debatte über Lohnsklaverei hat das Oberhaus erfasst, und die sozialistische Partei gewinnt mit ihrer Befürwortung einer dringend erforderlichen Lohnreform an Boden. Die breite Unterstützung der Öffentlichkeit für weitere Sozialreformen hat dazu geführt, dass sich mehrere nominell nicht-sozialistische Abgeordnete von ihren Heimatwahlkreisen zunehmend unter Druck gesetzt sehen, weitere Reformen voranzutreiben. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass einige von ihnen sich überlegen, eventuell in den sozialistischen Block zu wechseln. Mit Hilfe politischer Manöver könnten wir wahrscheinlich einen massiven Überlauf zu den Sozialisten vermeiden, aber dies würde von der Bevölkerung unseres Landes wahrscheinlich als autokratische Aktion gewertet werden.;;Un debate sobre el salario mínimo ha tenido lugar en la cámara alta, y el partido socialista está ganando fuerza con el argumento de la necesidad de una reforma salarial. El amplio apoyo popular a más reformas sociales ha llevado a varios miembros de la casa que en teoría no son socialistas a verse cada vez más presionados por sus electorados locales para que impulsen más reformas, dando lugar a que algunos de ellos consideren cruzar el pasillo hacia el bloque socialista. Por medio de maniobras políticas, probablemente, podríamos evitar deserciones masivas hacia el bando socialista, pero seguramente sería visto por amplios segmentos de la población del país como un movimiento despótico.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18090;The Liberal caucus has convened to further press the agenda for political reform. Citing concerns about alleged infringements of the state apparatus into the private lives of citizens, and a political system firmly lodged in the hands of the few at the expense of the many, the liberals have threatened to block all bills from passing the Upper House until their concerns have been addressed. A few members of other parties are considering aligning themselves with the liberals on the issues of political reform, and any delay on our part will most likely serve to further increase popular frustration over the slow pace of reform.;Le caucus libéral est convoqué pour continuer l'ordre du jour de la réforme politique. Citant des préoccupations au sujet d'interventions alléguées de l'appareil étatique dans la vie privée des citoyens, et un système politique fermement ancrée dans les mains de quelques-uns au détriment de la majorité, les libéraux ont menacé de bloquer tous les projets de loi de passage à la Chambre haute jusqu'à ce que leurs préoccupations aient été abordées. Quelques membres des autres parties envisagent de s'aligner avec les libéraux sur les questions de réforme politique, et tout retard de notre part, très probablement, servira à augmenter encore la frustration populaire face à la lenteur de la réforme. ;Das liberale Gremium wurde einberufen, um die Agenda für politische Formen voranzutreiben. Die Liberalen berufen sich auf die angebliche Einmischung des Staats in das Privatleben der Bürger und ein politisches System, dass auf Kosten vieler fest in den Händen weniger liegt und drohen deshalb damit, sämtliche Gesetzentwürfe im Oberhaus zu blockieren, bis man sich um ihre Anliegen gekümmert hat. Einige wenige Mitglieder anderer Parteien ziehen in Betracht, sich bezüglich politischer Reformen auf die Seite der Liberalen zu schlagen, und jedwede Verzögerung unsererseits würde wahrscheinlich den Frust der Bevölkerung über das langsame Voranschreiten der Reformpläne noch weiter steigern.;;La asamblea liberal ha acordado hacer más presión sobre la agenda para la reforma política. Mencionando sus inquietudes por la supuesta injerencia del aparato del estado en la vida privada de los ciudadanos, y por un sistema político firmemente aposentado en las manos de unos pocos a costa de la mayoría, los liberales han amenazado con bloquear cualquier presupuesto en la cámara alta hasta que sus preocupaciones hayan sido abordadas. Algunos miembros de otros partidos están considerando la posibilidad de unirse a los liberales en lo tocante a asuntos de reforma política, y cualquier demora por nuestra parte dará lugar con toda probabilidad, a un mayor incremento de la frustración popular por el lento avance de la reforma.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18100;...it seems to me, therefore, a defect in our much lauded system that the lowliest workers can not even afford for themselves and their next of kin the bare minimums of sanitary living. The grimy, soot-ridden hovels, huddling under the shadows of the soot-stacks springing up like mushrooms after a rain storm, are damp and dark breeding grounds for flue, tuberculosis and immorality. A limited health reform, dear colleagues, would go far in amending these problems.'\n\nThe Upper House is in turmoil over it's apparent inability to pass social reform, despite mounting public demands.;... c'est il me semble, par conséquent, un défaut dans notre système tant vanté que les plus humbles des travailleurs ne peuvent même pas, pour eux-mêmes et leurs plus proches parents, avoir le minimum de la vie hygiénique. Les crasseux taudis de suie montés à la hâte poussent comme des champignons après la pluie, sont humides et sombres et sont des lieux de reproduction idéaux pour le choléra, la tuberculose et l'immoralité. Une réforme limitée de la santé, mes chers collègues, irait déjà loin pour s'attaquer à ces problèmes. \n\nLa Chambre haute est dans la tourmente sur son incapacité apparente à passer la réforme sociale, en dépit du support publique. ;... und deshalb erscheint es mir ein Fehler unseres viel gelobten System zu sein, dass sich wenig verdienende Arbeiter nicht einmal das absolute Minimum hygienischer Lebensbedingungen leisten können.

Sie sind klamm und dunkel, was Cholera, Tuberkulose und anderen Krankheiten ideale Ausbreitungsbedingungen bietet.

Los chamizos mugrientos que se amontonan a la sombra de los montones de hollín, brotando como hongos después de la tormenta, son criaderos húmedos y oscuros de cólera, tuberculosis e inmoralidad.

EVTDESC18110;I believe it possible that an agreement can be concluded.'\n\nA temporary Upper House Majority has formed on the issue of Unemployment Subsidies. Speaking in parliament, the conservative group leader has opined that he believes that the measures can be enacted, as an experiment with national policy, if nothing else. Citing fears of public discontent with the present plight of the unemployed, his group will back a proposal for modest unemployment benefits. Liberals in parliament remain wholly unconvinced of the proposition, but not enacting the proposal will be seen as a lost opportunity by those pushing for reform.;Je crois que c'est possible qu'un accord puisse être conclu. \n\nUne temporaire majorité à la Chambre haute s'est formée sur la question des allocations de chômage. Prenant la parole au parlement, le chef de file du groupe conservateur a exprimé l'avis qu'il estime que les mesures peuvent être adoptées, comme une expérimentation pour la politique nationale, et rien d'autre. Citant les craintes de mécontentement de la population face à la situation actuelle du chômage, son groupe soutiendra une proposition de modestes prestations de chômage. Les libéraux au Parlement restent entièrement convaincus de cette proposition, mais ne pas adopter la proposition sera considérée comme une occasion perdue par ceux qui poussent à la réforme. ;Ich glaube, dass wir zu einer Vereinbarung kommen können.'\n\nDie Einführung der Arbeitslosenunterstützung wird von einer Oberhausmehrheit unterstützt. Der Sprecher der konservativen Gruppe trug im Parlament vor, dass man die Maßnahmen zumindest versuchsweise in Kraft zu setzen. Die Gruppe begründet ihre Unterstützung einer einfachen Arbeitslosenunterstützung mit der Furcht vor wachsendem öffentlichen Unmut wegen der fortwährend hohen Arbeitslosigkeit. Die Liberalen im Parlament sind von dem Vorschlag weiterhin alles andere als überzeugt, aber die Nichtverabschiedung dieser Gesetzesvorlage würde von den Reformbefürwortern als verpasste Gelegenheit angesehen werden.;;Creo posible que se pueda llegar a un acuerdo.\n\nSe ha formado una mayoría parlamentaria temporal en la cámara alta en lo tocante a los subsidios de desempleo. Hablando en el parlamento, el líder del grupo conservador ha mantenido la opinión de que cree que las medidas pueden llevarse a cabo, como experimento de política nacional, cuando menos. Mencionando los temores de descontento público con la penosa situación actual de los desempleados, su grupo respaldará una propuesta para módicas prestaciones de desempleo. Los liberales del parlamento siguen sin estar del todo convencidos con la propuesta, pero no sacar a delante la propuesta se vería como una oportunidad perdida por aquellos que abogan por la reforma.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18120;I believe therefore that the only natural solution to the present polylemma is to argue in favor of my conservative colleagues on these issues.'\n\nThe strong popular support, combined with rising militancy, for a conservative national policy has led to friction in the Upper House. Several liberal members of parliament are considering defection to the conservative faction, and only ham-handed use of the party whip could possibly keep the liberals in their places.;Je crois donc que la seule solution naturelle à la présente polylemma (multiples dilemmes), est de plaider en faveur de mes collègues conservateurs sur ces questions. \n\nLe fort soutien populaire, combiné à la hausse du militantisme pour une politique conservatrice nationale, a conduit à des frictions à la Chambre haute. Plusieurs députés libéraux envisagent de faire défection à la faction conservatrice, et seulement l'utilisation maladroite du parti whip pourrait peut-être garder les libéraux à leur place. ;Ich glaube deshalb, dass die einzige natürliche Lösung des momentanen Dilemmas die Abstimmung zugunsten des Standpunkts meiner konservativen Kollegen ist.'\n\nDie starke Unterstützung der Öffentlichkeit einer konservativen Nationalpolitik hat zusammen mit der steigenden Militanz zu Spannungen im Oberhaus geführt. Mehrere liberale Parlamentsabgeordnete spielen mit dem Gedanken, sich der konservativen Fraktion anzuschließen, und nur der entschlossene Einsatz der Partei-Peitsche könnte die Liberalen in die Schranken weisen.;;Por lo tanto, creo que la única solución natural al actual dilema múltiple es decantarme en favor de mis colegas conservadores en tales asuntos.\n\nEl firme apoyo popular, combinado con una militancia en auge, a una política nacional conservadora ha dado lugar a fricciones en la cámara alta.

EVTDESC18130;A red wind seems to have taken a tour-de-force through the Upper House lately, as more and more members of parliament express their willingness to cooperate with, and support the ruling socialist party.

Plusieurs membres conservateurs du parlement envisagent de rejoindre la faction fasciste et empêcher de tels revirements de situation risque fort de renforcer le militantisme fasciste.;Die Falange reißt die Macht auf den Straßen und im Oberhaus an sich. Mehrere konservative Parlamentsabgeordnete spielen -- zur Not auf Biegen und Brechen -- mit dem Gedanken, sich der faschistischen Fraktion anzuschließen. Die Verhinderung dieser Bestrebungen würden zweifelsohne zur Erhöhung der faschistischen Militanz führen.;;La Falange está afianzando su poder tanto en las calles como en la cámara alta.

EVTDESC18160;And I believe therefore that freedom, shall it not perish from this realm, needs our constant vigilance on its behalf.\n\nA liberal member of the Upper House has held a rousing speech in parliament, criticising the government for what he claims is its failure to amend the rising tide of social unrest in the country. How should the government respond?;… et je crois donc que la liberté, pour ne pas périr de ce royaume, nécessite notre vigilance constante en son nom. \n\nUn député libéral de la Chambre haute a tenu un discours enflammé au Parlement, critiquant le gouvernement pour ce qu'il prétend être son incapacité à endiguer la marée montante de l'agitation sociale dans le pays.

EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed.

EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies.

EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press.

EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated-- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose.

EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected.

EVTDESC19350;Several witness reports over the past few years have spoken of the ongoing mistreatment of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial subjects in The Congo Free State. Widespread brutality, mutilation and even massacres have been reported as often used tools of colonial subjugation, and these reports have begun to cast the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy in a very poor light. An international organization -- The Congo Reform Association -- has now been founded with the stated goal of restoring human dignity to $COUNTRY$'s colonial subjects, and several well renowned authors and international humanitarians have rallied to the cause.;$COUNTRY$ : au cours des dernières années, des témoins ont rapporté les mauvais traitements qui ont cours à l’encontre des indigènes des colonies dans l’Etat Libre du Congo. Brutalité, mutilations et même massacres sont souvent utilisés comme outils de contrôle par les colons sur les indigènes et ces rapports commencent à jeter un éclairage sombre sur la politique coloniale de l’État $COUNTRY_ADJ$. Une association internationale, l’Association pour la Réforme au Congo, a été fondée dans le but de restaurer la dignité des indigènes des colonies de l’État $COUNTRY_ADJ$. Plusieurs auteurs de renom et des humanitaires internationaux se sont joints à la cause.;Mehrere Augenzeugenberichte während der letzten Jahre verdeutlichen die kontinuierliche Misshandlung von $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialuntertanen im Kongo-Freistaat. Man berichtete, dass weitläufige Brutalität, Verstümmelungen und sogar Massaker oft als Unterwerfungsmaßnahmen eingesetzt würden, und diese Berichten haben begonnen, die $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialpolitik in äußerst schlechtem Licht erscheinen zu lassen. Nun wurde eine internationale Organisation -- die Congo Reform Association -- gegründet, die es sich auf die Fahnen geschrieben hat, die Menschenwürde der Kolonialuntertanen von $COUNTRY$ wiederherzustellen. Mehrere bekannte Autoren und internationale Verfechter der Menschenwürde haben sich für ihre Sache stark gemacht.;;Durante los últimos años, varios testigos han dado testimonio de los malos tratos que reciben los súbditos coloniales de $COUNTRY$ en el estado libre del Congo. Según parece, las autoridades coloniales emplean con prodigalidad la brutalidad, la mutilación e incluso las masacres.

Se acaba de fundar una organización internacional, la Asociación para la Reforma del Congo, con el fin de devolver la dignidad a los súbditos coloniales de $COUNTRY$, y varios autores y filántropos famosos ya han anunciado su adhesión a la causa.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC19355_NEWS_LONG;The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Pact). Historians have not fully agreed on the dates, but 19471991 is common. It was termed as "cold" because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, although there were major regional wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan that the two sides supported. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences: the former being a single-party MarxistLeninist state, and the latter being a capitalist state with generally free elections. A self-proclaimed neutral bloc arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt, India, Indonesia and Yugoslavia; this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat but they each armed heavily in preparation for a possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear deterrent that deterred an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to total destruction of the attacker: the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). ;;Geopolitische Gelehrte stimmten letzte Woche mehrheitl. überein, dass das Erstarken nationaler Stimmungen, milit.

EVTDESC21000;One of the most common killers in the 19th century was tuberculosis, an infectious disease in humans that usually targets the lungs. Known today to be caused by various strains of mycobacteria, the historical explanations for tuberculosis range from vampirism to imbalances in the 'cardinal fluids'. Known since ancient times, and first described as a contagious disease by Avicenna in 1020, typical symptoms of the disease include chronic cough, fever, and the expulsion of blood-tinged phlegm. In the 19th century, the disease was sometimes romanticized, as several famous authors and poets of the era were known sufferers.;L'une des tueuses les plus communes du 19ème siècle a été la tuberculose, une maladie infectieuse chez l'homme qui cible généralement les poumons. Comprise, aujourd'hui, pour être provoquée par différentes souches de mycobactéries, alors que les explications historiques pour la tuberculose allaient du vampirisme à des déséquilibres dans les «fluides cardinaux». Connue depuis l'antiquité, et d'abord décrite comme une maladie contagieuse par Avicenne en 1020, les symptômes typiques de la maladie comprennent la toux chronique, la fièvre, et l'expulsion de mucosités teintées de sang. Au 19e siècle, la maladie a été parfois mêlée de romantisme, car plusieurs auteurs et poètes de l'époque étaient connus en souffrir. ;Einer der größten Geißeln der Menschheit im neunzehnten Jahrhundert war die Tuberkulose, eine ansteckende Krankheit, die meistens die Lungen befällt. Heute weiß man, dass sie durch verschiedene Mykobakterien-Stämme ausgelöst wird. Historische Erklärungen der Tuberkulose reichen von Vampirismus bis zum Ungleichgewicht der 'Kardinalflüssigkeiten'. Diese Krankheit ist seit dem Altertum bekannt und wurde erstmals von Avicenna im Jahr 1020 als ansteckende Krankheit beschrieben. Typische Symptome sind chronischer Husten, Fiber und die Ausscheidung blutversetzten Schleims. Im neunzehnten Jahrhundert wurde die Krankheit manchmal im romantischen Licht gesehen, da mehrere berühmte Autoren und Dichter dieser Ära unter ihr litten.;;Uno de los exterminadores más habituales del siglo XIX fue la tuberculosis, una enfermedad infecciosa en los humanos que normalmente ataca a los pulmones. Aunque hoy se sabe que está causada por diversas variedades de micro bacterias, las explicaciones históricas abarcan desde el vampirismo a desequilibrios en los 'fluidos primordiales'. Conocida desde los tiempos antiguos, y descrita por primera vez como enfermedad contagiosa por Avicena en 1020, los síntomas típicos de la enfermedad incluyen tos crónica, fiebre y expectoración de esputos sanguinolentos. Durante el siglo XIX, la enfermedad fue, en ocasiones, idealizada, ya que varios escritores y poetas famosos la padecieron.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC21030;The 'Spanish' Flu was an influenza pandemic that killed somewhere between 50-100 million people worldwide between the years 1918 to 1920. Due to increased trade, colonial contacts, commerce and other myriads of global connections that had all increasingly made the world a smaller place throughout the 19th century, the Spanish flu was able to spread quickly across the world in a mere few years. Further aggravated by the on-going first world war, and the cramped living conditions in the trenches, the Spanish flu is one of the first and most terrifying examples of a truly global pandemic. And... come to think of it... haven't you been feeling a bit feverish, lately?;La « grippe espagnole » était une pandémie de grippe qui a tué entre 50 et 100 millions de personnes à travers le monde de 1918 à 1920. En raison de l'accroissement des échanges, des contacts coloniaux, du commerce et des myriades d'autres connexions mondiales qui avaient toutes, de plus en plus, fait du monde un endroit plus petit tout au long du 19e siècle, la grippe espagnole a pu se propager rapidement à travers le monde entier en quelques années seulement .

Verstärkte internationale Handelsbeziehungen, Kontakte mit Menschen aus Kolonien und anderweitige globale Verbindungen hatte die Welt im neunzehnten Jahrhundert zu einem kleineren Ort gemacht. Aus diesem Grund konnte sich die spanische Grippe innerhalb weniger Jahre auf der ganzen Welt verbreiten. Zusätzlich verschlimmert wurde sie durch die Kämpfe des ersten Weltkriegs und die beengten Lebensbedingungen in den Schützengräben. Die spanische Gruppe ist eine der ersten und fürchterlichsten Beispiele für eine echte globale Pandemie.

EVTDESC22010;The idea of isolating offenders and breachers of the public peace from society in general is probably as old as time itself.

EVTDESC22040;Up and down the roads they march, in single narrow defile, carrying with them, wherever they go, the iron chains of unfree men. These people are not slaves, but convicts, and they have been sentenced by courts and magistrates of justice and peace, to work and spill their sweat under the burning sun. They are a common sight in $COUNTRY$, for there are many men like them. Forced labor is, and has long been, one of the most common forms of punishment available to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ courts. Hard work, it has been said, will improve the moral understanding of these cretins, and, therefore, work they do.;Monter et descendre les routes qu'ils empruntent, dans un défilé étroit, emportant avec eux, où qu'ils aillent, les chaînes de fer des hommes non libres.

EVTDESC22050;A state-wide manhunt has been called in one of our states, as police report that a convicted murderer has escaped from a local prison facility. While unsettling in itself, the news has also brought our nation's prison system to the public spot-light, fueling a national debate on the issues of crime & punishment. Liberals argue that the escape merely serves as further indictment of the dilapidated and tragic state of our nation's prison system, while conservatives point to the natural constraints on the national budget, and argue that we should not spend the better part of our money on what is arguably the worst part of our citizenry.;Une chasse à l'homme à l'échelle de l'État a été lancée, comme le signale le rapport de police alors qu'un meurtrier s'est évadé d'un établissement pénitentiaire local.

Les libéraux soutiennent que cette fuite sert leur futur acte d'accusation du tragique état délabré du système carcéral de notre pays, tandis que les conservateurs pointent les contraintes naturelles sur le budget national, et affirment que nous ne devrions pas dépenser la meilleure partie de notre argent pour ceux qui sont sans doute les pires de nos citoyens.;In einem unserer Staaten wurde eine landesweite Verbrecherjagd gestartet, nachdem die Polizei den Ausbruch eines verurteilten Mörders aus einem lokalen Gefängnis gemeldet hat.

Liberale argumentieren, der Ausbruch sei lediglich ein weiterer Beweis für den maroden und tragischen Zustand des Gefängnissystems unserer Nation, während Konservative auf den eingeschränkten Staatshaushalt hinweisen und davon abraten, einen bedeutenden Teil unseres Geldes für den Bodensatz unserer Gesellschaft ausgeben.;;En uno de nuestros estados, se ha emitido una orden de busca y captura a nivel estatal, ya que la policía ha informado que un asesino convicto ha escapado de un centro penitenciario local.

EVTDESC22070;As the 19th century dawned on Europe, the practice of jailing people who defaulted on their debts was still norm. In England, infamous examples of such institutions - Debtor's Prisons - include London's Fleet Prison. In these institutions debtors where not seldom expected to pay for both board and room, and sometimes even special 'Jailor's Fees', to effectively pay their jailors for their upkeep. Often times, these practices only served to further complicate the debtor's financial situation, as it for natural reasons is hard to earn money from inside a prison wall. The system was gradually abandoned in most European countries throughout the 19th century, and London's Fleet Prison was torn down in 1846. A wrongly jailed $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrat is now drawing public attention to these institutions, calling for their abolishment.;A l'aube du 19ème siècle sur l'Europe, les personnes emprisonnées par manque de remboursement de dettes restent la norme en Angleterre, avec des exemples de célèbres institutions  les prisons des débiteurs - notamment celle de la prison londonienne de la flotte. Dans ces institutions, les débiteurs, où rarement on s'attend à payer pour à la fois le gîte et le couvert et parfois même des honoraires spéciaux, payent effectivement leur geôlier pour leur entretien quotidien. Souvent, ces pratiques ne faisaient que compliquer davantage la situation financière du débiteur, pour la raison naturelle, qu'il est difficile de gagner de l'argent de l'intérieur des murs d'une prison. Le système a été progressivement abandonné dans la plupart des pays européens tout au long du 19ème siècle, et à Londres la prison de la flotte a été démolie en 1846. Un aristocrate $COUNTRY_ADJ$, emprisonné à tort, est en train d'attirer l'attention du public sur ces institutions, appelant à leur suppression.;Noch wenige Jahrzehnte vor dem neunzehnten Jahrhundert war es noch gängige Praxis, zahlungsunfähige Menschen zu inhaftieren. Das Londoner Fleet-Gefängnis in England war ein berüchtigtes Beispiel für eine derartige Einrichtung. In diesen Gefängnissen wurde es von den Schuldnern nicht selten verlangt, für Kost und Logis selbst aufzukommen. Manchmal mussten sie sogar zusätzliche 'Jailor's Fees' entrichten, um den Unterhalt der Gefängnisse, in den sie einsaßen, zu sichern. Oftmals wurde die finanzielle Situation eines inhaftierten Schuldners dadurch nur noch verschlimmert, da das Geldverdienen hinter Gefängnismauern selbstverständlich sehr mühsam war. Im Verlauf des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts wurde das System in den meisten europäischen Ländern allmählich abgeschafft. Das Londoner Fleet-Gefängnis wurde im Jahr 1846 abrissen. Ein zu Unrecht inhaftierter $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Aristokrat zieht nun die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit auf diese Einrichtung und verlangt deren Abschaffung.;;Con el inicio del siglo XIX en Europa, la práctica de encarcelar a gente que habían incumplido el pago de sus deudas seguía vigente. En Inglaterra, entre los infames ejemplos de tales instituciones - Prisiones del deudor - se encuentra la prisión de Fleet, en Londres. En tales instituciones, no era extraño que los deudores tuvieran que pagar mesa y alojamiento, y, en ocasiones, incluso, 'honorarios de carcelero' especiales, para pagar a sus carceleros por su cuidado. Muy a menudo, tales prácticas solo servían para agravar más la situación financiera del deudor, pues, por razones lógicas, es complicado ganar dinero tras los muros de una prisión. A lo largo del siglo XIX, el sistema fue abandonado gradualmente por la mayoría de países europeos, y la prisión londinense de Fleet fue demolida en 1846.

EVTDESC22080;A debate in the $CAPITAL$ Reform Club tonight, regarding the death penalty, has seen new arguments advanced from the opponents of the punishment. Focusing in on the irrevocability of the punishment, in tandem with the ever present risk of wrongful sentencing, liberals have joined together to form a Citizen's committee to abolish the sentence. The debate has been caused by the much publicized recent execution of an elderly gentleman convicted of murdering his wife, despite the fact that the man was clearly in the advanced stages of age related dementia. The newly founded committee calls upon members of parliament to speak out against what they consider to be the most horrendous of injustices, and have sought an audience with the cabinet to explain their position.;Un débat ce soir au club de réforme de $CAPITAL$, en ce qui concerne la peine de mort, a vu de nouveaux arguments avancés par les opposants à la peine.

Die Debatte wurde durch die stark publizierte, vor kurzem vollzogene Hinrichtung eines betagten Ehrenmannes für den Mord an seiner Frau ausgelöst, obwohl der Mann ganz eindeutig bereits stark dement war. Das neugegründete Komitee ruft Parlamentsmitglieder auf, sich gegen diese in ihren Augen entsetzliche Ungerechtigkeit auszusprechen, und haben beim Parlament um eine Audienz gebeten, um ihren Standpunkt darzulegen.;;Esta noche, dentro de un debate en el 'Reform Club' de $CAPITAL$ sobre la pena capital, los oponentes a dicho castigo han visto cómo sus nuevos argumentos ganaban terreno.

Le debate se ha producido a raíz de la reciente y muy difundida ejecución de un anciano gentilhombre condenado por el asesinato de su esposa, a pesar de que el hombre presentaba claros síntomas de un avanzado estado de demencia senil. El recién fundado demanda a los miembros del parlamento que se pronuncien en contra de lo que consideran la más horrenda de las injusticias, y han solicitado audiencia con el consejo de ministros para exponer su postura.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC23302;The renowned French marine biologist Pierre Arronax was found washed up on the shores of $COUNTRY$ today. The professor has been gone for quite some time since joining an expedition sent out to discover the truth behind a mysterious whale said to sink and devour ships on the high seas. The professor is shocked by the profound experience he has had, and his story is indeed remarkable. Arronax claims that he was washed overboard during a close encounter between his ship and the creature, and that the creature is in fact a human ship, capable of under water travel. Arronax maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor Arronax's many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms -- supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel -- will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come.;Le célèbre spécialiste français de biologie marine a été découvert aujourd’hui rejeté par la mer sur une plage du pays : $COUNTRY$.

Le professeur est en état de choc après l’expérience qu’il a connu et son histoire est tout à fait remarquable. Arronax affirme qu’il a été jeté par dessus bord lors d’une rencontre entre son navire et la créature et que cette créature est en fait un navire fait de main d’homme capable de voyager sous la mer. Arronax affirme que ce navire est, ou était, commandé par un justicier épris de liberté qui a rompu tout contact avec la terre ferme pour vivre une existence de liberté sur les océans du monde à bord de son navire.

Der Professor war einige Zeit verschwunden gewesen, seit er sich einer Expedition zur Aufklärung des Geheimnisses um einen mysteriösen Wal angeschlossen hatte, der angeblich auf hoher See ganze Schiffe versenkte und verschlang. Der Professor ist von seinen tiefgreifenden Erlebnissen schockiert, und seine Geschichte ist wahrlich beachtenswert. Arronax behauptet, dass er bei einem Aufeinandertreffen mit der Kreatur über Bord ging, und dass es sich bei der Kreatur in Wahrheit um ein von Menschen gesteuertes Schiff handle, das unter Wasser fahren kann. Arronax behauptet weiter, dass dieses Schiff von einem freiheitsliebenden Eigenbrötler kommandiert wird oder wurde, der sich jeglichem Kontakt mit dem Festland abgeschworen hat und lieber an Bord seines Schiffes ein Leben in Freiheit auf den Ozeanen dieser Welt lebt. Was auch letztendlich die Wahrheit sein mag, die zahlreichen detaillierten Beschreibungen vieler bemerkenswerter neuer Lebensformen, die Professor Arronax -- vermutlich während seiner Zeit als Gast an Bord dieses merkwürdigen Schiffes -- gemacht hat, werden unseren wissenschaftlichen Bemühungen auf Jahre hinaus zugute kommen.;;El famoso biólogo marino francés, Pierre Arronax, ha aparecido hoy en las playas de $COUNTRY$.

El sujeto, profundamente afectado por la experiencia sufrida, relata una historia ciertamente notable.

EVTDESC2530;A colonial regiment in one of our colonies has had an encounter with a regiment from another colonial power, which had, according to a military report, crossed into our colonial claim on an obscure waterway a fair distance into the colony's hinterland. The report further goes on to state that this foreign regiment was, when encountered by our patrol, in the process of conducting a geological survey of the area, the object of which is as of yet unknown to us. Hawkish members of our war cabinet see this as a direct assault on $COUNTRY$'s territorial integrity, and call for the execution of a plan they have termed, quite simply, 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fury'.;Un régiment colonial de l'une de nos colonies s'est heurté à un régiment d'une autre puissance coloniale qui avait, selon un rapport militaire, accédé à notre territoire par un obscur cours d'eau avant de gagner l'arrière-pays de la colonie.

With living and health conditions in the cities worsening on account of overcrowding, pollution and poor housing, some people, predominantly from the middle classes, have come to yearn again for the peace and quiet of country life, and, with living standards and wages increasing, more and more people can also afford the occasional trip out of town for some rest and recreation in the fresh open air of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ country side.;Il vit dans une maison, une maison très grande, à la campagne.\n\nAvec nos centres urbains s’accroissant de jour en jour, un flux constant de fermiers issus de nos campagnes se déversent en ville.

EVTDESC3003;Aye, I'd say they fed the pigs better than they ever did us.'\n\nA local scandal coming out of one of our states has garnered a fair amount of national attention during the last few weeks. Apparently, a foreman at one of the local workhouses has embezzled public funds allotted to him, and recovered the losses by serving poorer quality food, sometimes not more than a few slices of bread each day, to the people employed by the institution. The case has become a soap-box for conservatives and liberals alike, with conservatives arguing against government intervention and liberals arguing the need for more social reforms.;C’est pas normal, les porcs étaient mieux nourris que nous !\n\nUn scandale dans une de nos régions a bénéficié d’une audience nationale durant ces dernières semaines. Apparemment un dirigeant d’une institution publique a détourné des fonds du gouvernement alloués à cette dernière en y servant de la nourriture de mauvaise qualité et en empochant la différence. La nourriture était très mauvaise, parfois pas plus que quelques tranches de pain pour toute une journée. Ce cas est devenu une pomme de discorde entre conservateurs et libéraux, les premiers arguant contre l'intervention du gouvernement et les seconds insistant sur le besoin de réformes sociales.;Jawollja, ick würde schon sagen, dat se die Schweine immer schon besser jefüttert ham als uns.'\n\nEin lokaler Skandal aus einem unserer Staaten hat in den letzten Wochen eine Menge nationaler Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen. Es scheint, dass ein Vorarbeiter in einem der örtlichen Arbeitshäuser ihm anvertraute Gelder unterschlug und die Verluste dadurch aufwog, in dem er den dort angestellten Menschen schlechtere Mahlzeiten anbot, manchmal nur ein paar Scheiben Brot pro Tag. Der Fall ist ein gefundenes Fressen für Konservative wie Liberale geworden, wobei die Konservativen gegen Regierungsintervention argumentieren und die Liberalen nach mehr Sozialreformen verlangen.;;Sí, diría que alimentaban mejor a los cerdos que a nosotros.\n\nUn escándalo local en uno de nuestros estados ha atraído la atención nacional durante las últimas semanas. Aparentemente, el jefe de uno de las casas taller locales ha malversado fondos públicos y ha recuperado las pérdidas sirviendo comida de peor calidad (a veces tan solo unas rebanadas de pan al día), a la gente empleada por la institución. El caso se ha convertido en un modelo de discurso tanto para conservadores como para liberales, en el que los conservadores están en desacuerdo con la intervención del gobierno y los liberales abogan por la necesidad de más reformas sociales.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC3005;Thus, an additional few thousand dead this year can be attributed to the ravages of tuberculosis in our state.'\n\nA local physician's privately published report on the state of health care in his home state has caused a small public uproar in $COUNTRY$. Among general talk of the unsanitary and cramped living conditions that the disease seems to thrive on, the report is also severely critical of the government for not doing more in preventing the spread of tuberculosis by a stricter policy of quarantine, and for not providing adequate facilities for treatment. Conservatives lampoon the report as a hysterical opinion piece, and acting on it might anger them. On the other hand, we could use a sanitarium.;Ainsi, mille morts de plus cette année sont imputables aux ravages de la tuberculose dans notre région.\n\nLe rapport d’un spécialiste, sur l'état de santé des habitants dans une de nos régions, a causé un tumulte dans l’opinion publique de $COUNTRY$. L’accroissement de conditions antihygiéniques et la promiscuité semblent permettre à la maladie de prospérer. En outre le rapport critique sévèrement le gouvernement, de ne pas en faire suffisamment pour empêcher la diffusion de la tuberculose par une politique plus stricte de quarantaine, et de ne pas fournir les équipements adéquats pour le traitement. Une action sur ce sujet pourrait irriter les Conservateurs. Néanmoins la construction d’un sanatorium pourrait être profitable à notre pays.;Daher können weitere Tausende von diesjährigen Toden in unserem Staat den Schrecken der Tuberkulose zugeschrieben werden.'\n\nDer privat veröffentlichte Bericht eines örtlichen Arztes über den Zustand der Gesundheitsfürsorge in seinem Heimatstaat hat zu einem kleinen öffentlichen Aufruhr in $COUNTRY$ geführt. Außer allgemeinen Ausführungen über die unhygienischen und gedrängten Zustände, welche die Krankheit geradezu aufblühen lässt, äußert der Bericht weiterhin scharfe Kritik an der Regierung für ihre Untätigkeit in Sachen Tuberkuloseverhütung durch striktere Quarantänemaßnahmen, und dafür, keine geeigneten Behandlungseinrichtungen abzubieten. Konservative verspotten den Bericht als hysterische Polemik, und eine freundliche Reaktion unsererseits auf den Bericht könnte sie verärgern. Auf der anderen Seite könnten wir schon ein Sanitarium gebrauchen.;;Por tanto, este año pueden achacarse miles de muertos adicionales a los estragos que ha causado la tuberculosis en nuestro estado.\n\nUn médico local ha publicado un informe sobre el estado de la sanidad pública en su estado natal que ha provocado un pequeño escándalo en $COUNTRY$. Además de los comentarios generales de las condiciones de vida lamentables que los enfermos tienen que soportar, el informe es muy crítico con el gobierno por no haber prevenido mejor la propagación de la tuberculosis, con una política de cuarentena estricta y por no contar con instalaciones adecuadas para su tratamiento.

EVTDESC32505;In 1880, Fyodor Dostoevsky completed his magnum opus, 'The Brothers Karamazov'. One of the most arresting works in the entire history of literature, 'The Brothers Karamazov' was a comedy that developed the major themes of Dostoevsky's post-Socialist career as a writer. A comedy, perhaps, but arguably the most serious comedy ever written. In his memoir, 'The Diary of a Writer', Dostoevsky dismissed leftist criticisms of his work by remarking that no leftist had ever provided as damaging a critique of Christianity as his Chapters 'Rebellion' and 'The Grand Inquisitor' in The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky's works were hugely influential not only in Russia but also throughout the West,  and not only in literary circles, but in philosophical and religious ones as well.;"En 1880, Fiodor Dostoïevski a terminé son magnum opus, «les frères Karamazov».

Une comédie, peut-être, mais sans doute la comédie plus sérieuse jamais écrite. Dans ses mémoires, ""le journal d'un écrivain"", Dostoïevski a rejeté ses détracteurs de gauche sur son travail en faisant remarquer qu'aucun de gauche n'avait jamais fourni une aussi préjudiciable critique du christianisme comme dans ses chapitres «rébellion» et «le grand inquisiteur».

Bei diesem Buch, einem der fesselndsten literarischen Werke der Menschheitsgeschichte, handelt es sich um eine Komödie, die sich um Dostojewskis post-sozialistische Karriere als Autor dreht. Es ist jedoch eine der ernstesten Komödien, die jemals geschrieben wurde. Dostojewski schmetterte in seinen Memoiren 'Tagebuch eines Autors' linke Kritik ab, indem er bemerkte, dass kein Linker jemals solch aufrüttelnde Kritik an der Christenheit geübt hätte, wie es in den Kapiteln 'Rebellion' und 'Der Großinquisitor' von 'Die Brüder Karamasow' getan worden wäre.

Puede que se tratase de una comedia, pero tal vez fuera la comedia más seria jamás escrita. En sus memorias, 'El diario de un escritor', Dostoievski rechazó las acusaciones de la izquierda a su trabajo diciendo que ningún izquierdista había escrito una crítica del cristianismo más devastadora que los capítulos 'Rebelión' y 'El Gran Inquisidor' de 'Los Hermanos Karamazov'.

EVTDESC3301;As our average life expectancies have increased over the years, more and more families have had to take care of their elderly who are no longer able to provide for themselves. The social makeup of our country is changing, and without much in way of a national plan for the elderly and the disabled, a lot are falling between the cracks in the system. Conservatives have by and large taken the stance that the family is the first and last social support structure for the elderly, and that an increasing role for government in the area threatens to unravel important societal bonds. Liberals, on the other hand, see our pensions as tragically lacking, pointing to the many who, seemingly, go without aid.;À mesure que l'espérance de vie moyenne augmente au cours des dernières années, de plus en plus de familles ont dû prendre soin de leurs personnes âgées devenues dépendantes.

EVTDESC35700;Pope Leo XIII's encyclical on the 'Rights and Duties of Capital and Labour' began with the words 'Rerum Novarum'. In the encyclical's analysis, the spirit of socialist revolutionary change had begun to pervade ever more areas. The causes of the conflict, it claimed, were clear: The vast expansion of industrial pursuits, the changed relations between masters and workmen, the accumulation of enormous fortunes by a few individuals and the utter poverty of the masses, and the prevailing moral degeneracy.  The encyclical argued that Socialism threatened the religious and moral foundation of the state and sought to break the common interests of the Church and State, the employer and the employed, and replace them with an evil, atheist doctrine. To counter this threat, associations must be formed that satisfy the needs of progress and yet protect the weak. The encyclical quoted the Apostle Paul saying that 'Charity is patient, is kind ... seeketh not her own ... suffereth all things ... endureth all things'.;L'encyclique du pape Léon XIII sur les «droits et devoirs du capital et du travail» commence avec les mots «Rerum Novarum». D'après l'analyse de l'encyclique, l'esprit de changement révolutionnaire socialiste a commencé à envahir de plus en plus de zones. Les causes du conflit, selon elle, sont claires : la vaste expansion des activités industrielles, les relations changées entre patrons et ouvriers, l'accumulation de fortunes énormes par quelques individus et la pauvreté extrême des masses, ou encore la dégénérescence morale qui prévaut. L'encyclique fait valoir que le socialisme menace la fondation religieuse et morale de l'État et cherche à briser les intérêts communs de l'Église et l'État, de l'employeur et de l'employé, et les remplacer par un mal, la doctrine athée. Pour contrer cette menace, des associations doivent être formées qui répondront aux besoins de progrès et devront déjà protéger les faibles. L'encyclique cite l'apôtre Paul disant que «la charité est patiente, en quelque sorte ... ne cherche pas le sien ... souffre toutes choses ... supporte toutes les choses». ;Die Enzyklika von Papst Leo XIII. über die 'Rechten und Pflichten des Kapitals und der Arbeit' beginnt mit den Worten 'Rerum Novarum'. Der Geist der sozialistischen Revolution hat sich in immer mehr Gebieten verbreitet. Die Ursachen für die Konflikte sind klar: Die starke Ausdehnung industrieller Interessen, das veränderte Verhältnis zwischen Herren und Arbeitern, der enorme Reichtum einzelner Individuen, völlige Armut der Massen und die herrschende moralische Entartung. Der Sozialismus bedroht das religiöse und moralische Fundament der Kirche und scheint mit den allgemeinen Interessen der Kirche, des Staats, der Arbeitgeber und der Arbeitnehmer zu kollidieren und sie durch eine böse atheistische Doktrin zu ersetzen. Es müssen Vereinigungen geschaffen werden, die sowohl den erforderlichen Fortschritt befriedigen als auch die Schwachen beschützen können. Wie sagte schon der Apostel Paulus: 'Nächstenliebe ist geduldig und fromm, ... suchet nicht ihresgleichen, ... erleidet alle Dinge, ... erduldet alle Dinge.';Rerum Novarum;La encíclica del papa León XIII sobre los 'Derechos y obligaciones del capital y el trabajador' comienza con las palabras 'Rerum Novarum'. En su análisis, el espíritu del cambio revolucionario socialista había empezado a extenderse a más áreas que nunca. Las causas del conflicto eran: la expansión de las actividades industriales, el cambio de relaciones entre patronos y trabajadores, la acumulación de fortunas en unos cuantos y la pobreza de las masas, y la degeneración moral imperante. Argumentaba que el socialismo amenazaba la religiosidad y la moral del estado y pretendía la ruptura de los intereses comunes de la Iglesia y el Estado, del empresario y el empleado, y los sustituía por una doctrina malvada y atea. Para contrarrestar tal amenaza, debían formarse asociaciones que satisficieran las necesidades de progreso e incluso protegieran al débil.

EVTDESC3602;An almost new idea has been adopted by the construction workers of $COUNTRY$: safety helmets. The first ones to be used were old combat helmets which war veterans had given to their sons, and after the helmets have saved one worker's life, others began wearing similar headgear to work.

This has improved the safety at the building sites and very few workers are hurt by accidentally dropped tools or other things.;Une attitude nouvelle s’est répandue parmi les travailleurs du bâtiment de $COUNTRY$ : le port de casques de sécurité.

Die ersten waren alte Militärkampfhelme, die Kriegsveteranen ihren Söhnen gegeben hatten, und nachdem ein Helm das Leben eines Arbeiters gerettet hatte, begannen andere, ähnlichen Kopfputz zur Arbeit zu tragen. Manchmal wurden selbst alte Kessel und Töpfe umfunktioniert. Dies hat die Sicherheit auf den Baustellen erhöht, und mittlerweile werden nur noch sehr wenige Arbeiter durch fallengelassene Gegenstände verletzt.;;Los obreros de la construcción de $COUNTRY$ han adoptado una idea prácticamente nueva: cascos de seguridad.

Más y más agitadores parecen concentrarse en las puertas de la fábrica, pidiendo que los trabajadores se organicen en sindicatos y se levanten contra lo que ellos describen como el sistema de explotación capitalista.

EVTDESC3901;And, because the opinions of our men of labour need to be given a clear and unambiguous medium of expression, membership in the union should be made mandatory for all employees of the state'\n\nA strong political current in parliament have begun arguing for mandatory association with the National Union for any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public employee. The suggestion has received some support from circles within the trade union movement, and many are arguing that the suggestion might serve as a good compromise with those who argue for further liberalisation of the trade union laws. What is the government's position?;Et, parce que les opinions de nos travailleurs doivent être donnés sans ambiguïté par un support d'expression, l'adhésion à l'Union devrait être rendue obligatoire pour tous les employés de l'Etat. \n\nUne forte volonté politique en cours au parlement a commencé à discuter pour une association obligatoire avec l'Union nationale pour tout employé public de $COUNTRY_ADJ$.

EVTDESC3902;A so-called 'Friendly Society' has been established in one of our provinces. The Friendly Society is a loose association of people, often working in the same or similar trades as each other, dedicated to providing members with mutual economic assistance in the forms of unemployment insurance, loans and cooperative banking.

The club has made it its agenda to reform the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ voting system, and they have initially been able to gain a fair amount of political traction in the public debate. The club wants to see our Jeffersonian voting system replaced with one of proportional representation. The club argues that a proportional representation allows for a fairer and more balanced representation for the totality of our population, rather than for arbitrary political voting circles.

In it he asserted that law was not logical, but rather the will of the judge tempered by circumstances, or,  as its most famous maxim put it, The Life of the law has not been logic, but experience. It quickly became a classic and Holmes was appointed to a professorship at Harvard the next year and was eventually made a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Im wichtigsten Denkspruch dieses Werks formulierte Holmes diesen Gedanken folgendermaßen: 'The life of the law has not been logic, but experience.'

When asked how the newspaper could pass the censorship process, The Censorship Bureau has pointed to several old reports detailing it's lack of resources.

Despite Macdonald’s claims of innocence, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister. Donald A. Smith’s lack of confidence in Macdonald only further contributed to the decline of the party’s popularity;Après que l'administration conservatrice a été voté à la majorité au Parlement en 1872, des accusations ont été portées contre John A. Macdonald de nature les plus graves. Le projet de compagnie de Macdonald était un chemin de fer trans-continental, et le gouvernement libéral a accusé Sir Hugh Allan de lui avoir donné ses propres fonds de campagne en échange d'un contrat garantie avec sa compagnie 'Canadien Pacifique'. En dépit des affirmations d'innocence de Macdonald, il a été forcé de démissionner en tant que Premier ministre. Le manque de confiance dans Macdonald contribuera, plus tard, à la baisse de popularité du parti. ;Nachdem die Konservativen in den Parlamentswahlen von 1872 die Mehrheit der Stimmen erringen konnten, erhoben sie schärfste Anklagen gegen John A. Macdonald. Macdonalds Lieblingsprojekts war die transkontinentale Eisenbahn gewesen und die Liberalen beschuldigten ihn, dass ihm Sir Hugh Allan Firmenfonds als Ausgleich für eine Vertragsgarantie für sein Unternehmen Canadian Pacific gegeben hätte. Obwohl Macdonald seine Unschuld beteuerte, trat er als Premierminister zurück. Durch das mangelnde Vertrauen von Donald A. Smith in Macdonald wurde die Unbeliebtheit der Partei nur noch verstärkt.;El escándalo Pacific;Después de que la administración conservadora consiguiese la mayoría en las elecciones al parlamento de 1871, se presentaron muy serias acusaciones contra John A. Macdonald. El proyecto favorito de John A. Macdonald era el ferrocarril transcontinental, y la administración liberal le acusaba de que Sir Hugh Allan había donado fondos para su campaña a cambio de un contrato garantizado con su compañía, la Canadian Pacific. Pese a sus protestas de inocencia, Macdonald se vio obligado a dimitir como primer ministro. La falta de confianza de Donald A. Smith en Macdonald sólo sirvió para impulsar el declive de la popularidad del partido.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44301;The Métis people were a group of small communities of French-Indian blood in the Manitoba region who had hopes of self-government. Unfortunately their dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Métis people, led by Louis Riel, revolted. Louis Riel was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Métis people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Louis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected. Thus, Manitoba, the postage-stamp province, was born.;Le peuple métis était un groupe de petites communautés de sang franco-indien dans la région du Manitoba qui avait l'espoir d'une accession à l'autonomie gouvernementale. Malheureusement, leurs rêves ont été anéantis quand la terre de la baie d'Hudson, dont ils faisaient partie, a été donnée au Canada sans leur consentement. En signe de protestation le peuple métis, conduit par Louis Riel, s'est révolté. Louis Riel était un homme très religieux, qui avait étudié pour le clergé dans une vie antérieure. Il a combattu pour le peuple Métis et est devenu un héros aux yeux de la population manitobaine. Louis a négocié avec le gouvernement canadien pour l'entrée du Manitoba dans la Confédération. Les délégués canadiens ont garanti que les droits du peuple seraient respectés. Ainsi, le Manitoba, une province 'timbre-poste', est né. ;Die Métis waren eine kleine Gruppe französisch-indianischer Mischlinge in der Manitoba-Region, die sich Hoffnungen auf Selbstverwaltung machten. Unglücklicherweise wurden diese Träume zerstört, als das Gebiet um die Hudson Bay ohne ihre Zustimmung an Kanada abgetreten wurde. Unter der Führung von Louis Riel erhoben sich die Métis dagegen. Louis Riel war ein tief religiöser Mann, der sich in seiner Jugend auf das Priesteramt vorbereitet hatte. Er kämpfte für die Métis und wurde dadurch in den Augen vieler Einwohner Manitobas zum Helden. Er verhandelte mit der kanadischen Regierung über einen Eintritt Manitobas in die Föderation. Die kanadischen Delegierten garantierten, die Respektierung der Rechte der Métis. Dies war die Geburtsstunde der Briefmarkenprovinz Manitoba.;Louis Riel y la primera rebelión de los mestizos;Los mestizos eran una agrupación de pequeñas comunidades de ascendencia mixta francesa e india de la región de Manitoba que tenían esperanzas de autogobierno. Por desgracia, sus sueños se vinieron abajo cuando el territorio de la Bahía de Hudson del que formaban parte fue entregado a Canadá sin su consentimiento. Como protesta, los mestizos se sublevaron al mando de Louis Riel. Louis Riel era un hombre profundamente religioso que estudió para sacerdote en su juventud. Luchó por los mestizos y fue considerado un héroe a ojos de la gente de Manitoba. Louis negoció con el gobierno canadiense el ingreso de Manitoba en la confederación. Los delegados canadienses aseguraron que se respetarían los derechos de la gente. De este modo nació la provincia de Manitoba.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44302;Although the Canadian government promised to respect the rights of the Métis, it did not appear to do so. Métis petitions for recognition of their land-holdings and institutions went unheeded. The Métis also became increasingly upset with the growing numbers of settlers from the east, invading their territories. In early 1885, the situation came to a head when the Métis once again took up arms in revolt. Adopting the Revolutionary Bill of Rights, the Métis established their own government and independence from Canada. Canadian troops came and crushed the rebellion. Louis Riel was tried and executed. The Métis would not be recognized officially as a people until a hundred years later.;Bien que le gouvernement canadien a promis de respecter les droits des Métis, il ne semble pas vouloir le faire. Des pétitions pour la reconnaissance de leurs biens fonciers et des institutions Métis, sont restées lettre morte. Les Métis sont aussi de plus en plus contrariés par le nombre croissant de colons de l'Est, qui envahissent leur territoire. Au début de 1885, la situation a atteint son paroxysme lorsque les Métis ont, de nouveau, pris les armes en se révoltant. Adoptant un projet de loi révolutionnaire, ils ont établi leur propre gouvernement et déclarés leur indépendance du Canada. Les troupes canadiennes sont alors intervenues et ont écrasé la rébellion. Louis Riel a été jugé et exécuté. Les Métis ne seront officiellement reconnus comme un peuple que cent ans après. ;Obwohl die kanadische Regierung versprochen hatte, die Rechte der Métis zu respektieren, schien dies nicht den Tatsachen zu entsprechen. Die Petitionen der Métis für die Anerkennung ihres Grundbesitzes wurden nicht beachtet. Die Métis wurde zudem durch die steigende Zahl von Siedlern beunruhigt, die in ihr Territorium einfielen. Anfang 1885 eskalierte die Situation, als sich die Métis erneut in einem bewaffneten Aufstand erhoben. Sie übernahmen die revolutionäre 'Bill of Rights', errichten eine eigene Regierung und erklärten ihre Unabhängigkeit von Kanada. Die Rebellion wurde schließlich von kanadischen Truppen niedergeschlagen. Louis Riel wurde vor Gericht gestellt und hingerichtet. Es sollte weitere hundert Jahre dauern, bis die Métis offiziell als Volk anerkannt wurden.;La rebelión del noroeste;Aunque el gobierno canadiense prometió respetar los derechos de los mestizos, no parece que fuera así. Las peticiones de los mestizos de que sus posesiones e instituciones fuesen reconocidas se desoyeron. Los mestizos también se sentían cada vez más disgustados ante la invasión de sus territorios por un creciente número de colonos procedentes del este. A principios de 1885, la situación estalló cuando los mestizos volvieron a tomar las armas y se rebelaron. Adoptando el 'Proyecto de ley revolucionario', los mestizos establecieron su propio gobierno, independizándose de Canadá. La rebelión fue aplastada por las tropas canadienses. Louis Riel fue juzgado y ejecutado. Los mestizos tardarían cien años en ser reconocidos oficialmente como pueblo.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion.

EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land-- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario-- being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it.

EVTDESC4436;The plight of an immigrant family that has spent three years trying to get permission for relatives to join them in $COUNTRY$ has recently come to the attention of the government.

EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833.

There is a call for France to go to war against Korea-- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries-- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which should have brought our Qing allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85003;Not unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favor with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85004;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which has brought our Qing allies to bear.

This may mean war with the French, but at least we know our allies remain strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation-- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move.

Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region.

EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support.

EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years.

EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be.

EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion.

EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence.

Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory.

EVTDESC90081;Egypt has been defeated, and the so-called Oriental Crisis brought to an end with the Ottoman Empire unquestionably the victor. The question now arises as to what should be done with them. There are those who argue that attempting to assume direct control over Egyptian lands would be folly, and that instead we should assume control over the Levant and any lands we have direct claim to... but keep them in our sphere of influence.

The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour.

Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet. do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of total war with one of the Great Powers of the world. In a modern age where warfare has the capability of killing millions, the very future of our nation could be at stake. The call has gone out to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: put aside your petty differences," your day-to-day lives and your personal ambitions. $COUNTRY$ must pull together in this, our hour of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people. Shortages of basic goods and the failure to deliver swift victory have worn down the enthusiasm with which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people initially greeted the war effort. If things don't turn around soon, we could face growing weariness and unrest within our own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96005;Growing demonstrations in $CAPITAL$ demonstrate the prevailing attitude of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: get us out of the war, and soon. Too many have been lost, too many sacrifices made, and all for what? The people wish to go back to their regular lives, without the constant spectre of war hanging over their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96006;The war effort is not going well, to put it lightly. Advisors are saying that $COUNTRY$ should sue for peace, do whatever it takes to end this war before something even more terrible happens. The people are on the brink of revolt. We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96010;We have lost the war, and like vultures the victors have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms regarding the breakup of our empire, with many of our lands simply given away, and we shall be permitted no overseas holdings whatsoever. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and we have been invited to the negotiating table to discuss the potential breakup of their empire. This could potentially mean we see $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands returned to us, though if we forego our claims it could mean salvaging a relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and now treaty talks have begun to discuss the breakup of their empire. As an enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$, our place at the table is assured. At the very least, any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands currently in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ possession should be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule. This would mean casting out $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials and potentially turning them into an enemy. We could maintain our close ties with $FROMCOUNTRY$ even with our freedom, though this would mean passing up a chance for freedom and goodwill from $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96016;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. They should not be allowed to keep these lands, but determinining how they should be disposed of is no simple matter. For now, agreement has been reached determining some of the territory, and any remaining will have to be negotiated over in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96017;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. We are not a great power, and it's possible that even if pursue some of their colonies for our own we'll end up with nothing... but if we do not try, we'll end up with nothing for sure. Even so, making the attempt could be seen as aggressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96020;With the war finished, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have taken to the streets of $CAPITAL$ in celebration. The toll of the war has been heavy, but today $COUNTRY$ is simply happy to be at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96022;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been created from the ether, but the powers-that-be have determined at least some of their lands rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$ and should be returned to us. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have rejoiced at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them. This may mean an unholy alliance with those who might never fight at our side otherwise, but as the old saying goes: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' If we are to win the war against $FROMCOUNTRY$, we may have to take that to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy... who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war. If we fight with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we stand the chance of gaining the spoils of war for ourselves. It also means we could fall with them. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96031;We have received word from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have agreed to an alliance. Whether or not they will actually live up to that alliance and join us in the war remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96065;A diplomatic incident with one of our enemies has outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several weeks ago, an envoy assigned to $CAPITAL$ was accused of stealing national secrets. It turned out the truth was far worse, and an investigation has unearthed a conspiracy to destablize $COUNTRY$ and leave it week for invasion. This has leaked out to the public, and now crowds in the capital are calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96066;The assassination of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen by a dissident has, after a thorough investigation, turned out to be at the instigation of an enemy power. This is but the latest in a string of incidents designed to destabilize $COUNTRY$. The results of the investigation have leaked to the public, and massive crowds gathered in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are now calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96070;According to the peace treaty, our colonies and overseas territories must be surrendered. Negotiations are currently underway as to which nations they will be 'assigned' to. It appears our humiliation is not yet complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96071;Negotiations are still underway as to which countries will obtain control over the remaining $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies and overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96081;An isolated $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory has been offered to us. We should consider whether we wish to adminster it, as accessing the land may be difficult according to current borders. But, then again, do we truly wish $FROMCOUNTRY$ to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96085;As the armies of our former enemy depart $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed democratic government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ question whether 'freedom' imposed by a foreign power is truly that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96086;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed right-wing government friendly to their nation.

EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame-- there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down.

EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTDESC96105;The general insurgency by $COUNTRY$'s Arab population has been brought to an end. For the moment, peace has been restored and the momentum of the Arab resistance dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down.

The transfer of all colonies and overseas territories to the other great powers.\n4. An agreement by $COUNTRY$ not to declare war on any other nation for a period of no less than ten years.\n\nIt goes without saying that these demands are extremely humiliating, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people would be justifiably upset should we agree.

The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. As Sikhs pour into the British frontier, it seems we are inevitably drawn into the conflict-- and there are some who believe that now might be the perfect time to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97120;Our lands in the Indian Raj have been overrun, our enemies among the Indians having successfully driven us off the subcontinent. We have been forced to consider whether we should retreat from India altogether. There are those in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who say the time has come: clearly the Indians wish us gone. Others say we must not submit to what amounts to a temporary setback.

EVTDESC97121;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to an abrupt end. With most of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ India either occupied or in disarray, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to retreat from the subcontinent completely.

EVTDESC97150;An alarming incident has occurred at the Talambó hacienda in Ica. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who has subsequently demanded the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain.

One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain.

One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility.

EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence.

EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima.

EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation.

EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote outselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit.

EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.

EVTDESC98007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press.

EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves.

EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether $COUNTRY$ will recognize their independence or treat them as subjects. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are chafing under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they still do not have true independence. There have been several altercations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military foces, and the recommendation of the Cape Town government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial forces and the Boer militia, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from $FROMCOUNTRY$ now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to create our own land, they yet follow us and refuse us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho.

EVTDESC98216;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now.

EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas-- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98248;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced.

EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations are eyeing the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$.

Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere.

EVTDESC98317;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the social liberal party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion-- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion-- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;With the Ottoman government having indicated its willingness to provide reforms, an intellectual class known as the Young Ottomans has arisen-- men influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution who are advocating the assumption of secular rather than religious laws as well as the provision of rights to ethnic minorities. This, they say, will help stem the tide of decay in the Empire. Most recently they have suggested embracing the Empire's Bulgarian minorities, maintaining that such a gesture would indicate a willingness to embrace European values. Mashriqi citizens have gotten wind of this, demanding that they as Muslims should receive preferential treatment. Reactionary officials have agreed, suggesting a move towards accepting the Empire's role as an Islamic power rather than away from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98621;Recently the Young Ottomans have been pushing for reform in the millet system, the governmental system under which the Empire's territories are allowed to govern themselves. The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-- a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire's former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the consitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place.

EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great.

EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures even if it means giving up some of their traditional claims to those lands.

EVTDESC98657;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have outright refused the proposed federation.

EVTDESC98720;With the loss of Hungary, the entire basis for the Danubian Federation has begun to crumble. The other ethnic groups are questioning the dominance that the German majority will exert without the Hungarians to counter-balance them, and increasingly there are demands for the federation to be undone. Some Germans are fine with this, preferring to return to the Austria that was, but many of them say that these other groups should not be permitted to break away. They say the Austrian Empire should be restored-- by force, if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98721;With the Danubian government having become a totalitarian regime, resentment among the various ethnic groups has reached a boiling point.

EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999001;The debate had been going on for several hours, when a candidate stepped forward and presented arguments for their cause which silenced all opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two.

EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies.

EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand.

EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere.

EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election-- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform as well as care for the environment. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the Muslims of faith in $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills.

EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n\nWhile being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward!

EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed.

EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!'

Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

El espíritu del cambio revolucionario socialista ha invadido un número cada vez mayor de áreas. Las causas de los conflictos están claras: la tremenda expansión de las empresas industriales, en las transformadas relaciones entre patrones y trabajadores, en las enormes fortunas de unos pocos individuos y la total pobreza de las masas y en la imperante degeneración moral. El socialismo amenaza los cimientos religiosos y morales del estado y pretende causar una ruptura en los intereses que comparten la iglesia, el estado, el patrón y el empleado, y los sustituye con una perversa doctrina atea. Deben nacer asociaciones que satisfagan las necesidades del progreso pero que protejan a los débiles. Como dice el apóstol San Pablo, 'La caridad es paciente, es amable... no busca lo suyo... sufre todas las cosas... soporta todas las cosas'.;El trabajo merece ser tan valorado como la riqueza.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Estalló un enfrentamiento y la policía arrestó a Louis Pio y a otros líderes socialistas. Pio fue condenado a cinco años de prisión.;¡Encerrémoslos!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36203;Pay him off and let's be done with him;Le payer pour qu'il parte;Bestecht ihn, damit er das Land verlässt;En 1875, el líder socialista Louis Pio fue indultado por el cumpleaños del rey y volvió a liderar el entonces pujante movimiento socialdemócrata. Pero su liderazgo causó varios conflictos y, a finales de 1875, emigró repentinamente a América. Luego se descubrió que la policía le había sobornado para que se marchase.;Paguémosle y acabemos con esto;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36204;Free the slaves;Libérer les esclaves;Sklaven befreien;En 1878 hubo una rebelión de esclavos en las Islas Vírgenes danesas. El gobernador Peter von Scholten decidió concederles la libertad antes que aplastar la rebelión, citando la ley de 1847 según la cual los recién nacidos de esclavos eran declarados libres.

Había dimitido tras haber usado el tesoro público para ayudar a financiar varios préstamos, y su arresto condujo a la caída del gobierno y a un 'Rigsretsag', un juicio de estado, contra Alberti y otros dos miembros del gabinete que le habían ayudado a ocultar su delito.;¡Maldición!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA36213;Splendid! Art for the people!;Splendide ! L'art pour le peuple !;Großartig! Kunst für das Volk!;La Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket fue fundada en 1892 por Carl Jacobsen, propietario de la compañía cervecera Ny Carlsberg. Al principio fue utilizada sobre todo para exhibir la vasta colección de escultura moderna de Carl Jacobsen, pero más tarde también se añadieron esculturas clásicas.;¡Espléndido! ¡Arte para el pueblo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36214;Are you trying to shoot me?;Vous voulez me tuer ?;Versuchen Sie, mich zu erschießen?;Estrup, durante muchos años primer ministro danés, no era un hombre demasiado popular.

EVTOPTA36401;The people's language for the nation;La langue du peuple pour la nation;Die Sprache des Volkes für die Nation.;El profesor Ivar Aasen (1813-1896), hijo de un agricultor, vio la necesidad de una reforma del lenguaje escrito noruego, que hasta ese momento había sido el danés. Mediante varios viajes por el país, visitando pequeñas aldeas y comunidades agrícolas, creó una gramática y un diccionario para un 'nuevo' idioma noruego. Aunque su codificación del lenguaje hablado no sirvió de mucho a la hora de educar a aquellos a quienes quería ayudar, muchos de sus poemas y textos fueron convertidos en canciones y, de ese modo, se difundieron por el mundo rural.

EVTOPTA36602;Speak free!;Liberté de parole !;Freie Meinungsäußerung!;El periódico vespertino sueco Aftonbladet apareció por primera vez el 6 de diciembre de 1830, bajo la dirección de Lars Johan Hierta. El gobierno no lo miraba con muy buenos ojos, ya que estaba a favor de la libertad de expresión, el libre comercio, la rebaja de las tasas aduaneras y las reformas democráticas. Despreciado por la clase alta y adorado por la clase media, el rey intentó en vano impedir su publicación, pero su tirada aumentó rápidamente durante los años siguientes. Con sus opiniones liberales, la importancia del Aftonbladet fue fundamental en la lucha por la libertad de prensa en Suecia.;¡Libertad de expresión!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36603;Call out the troops!;Qu'on appelle la troupe !;Ruft die Truppen zu Hilfe!;1848 fue un año de revoluciones y disturbios en Europa.

El rey acabó perdiendo la paciencia y llamando al ejército. Murieron alrededor de 30 personas y muchas más resultaron heridas.;¡Que intervengan las tropas!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ya no disfrutaba de la prosperidad de sus primeras décadas como puerto franco durante la Revolución y las guerras napoleónicas, y se había convertido en una carga económica.;¡Vender esa roca desolada YA!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36610;Law and order please!;Un peu d'ordre, s'il vous plaît;Ich bitte um Ruhe und Ordnung!;En 1879, la economía sueca se hallaba en recesión y los patrones de los aserraderos de Sundsvall se vieron obligados a recortar los sueldos. Estalló una huelga espontánea y organizada que llegó a alcanzar a 21 aserraderos y a afectar a 6.000 trabajadores. Fue la primera huelga a gran escala en Suecia. Unió a los trabajadores y sirvió como un primer punto de partida para los movimientos de las clases obrera y socialdemócrata, así como para la organización de los sindicatos en décadas venideras.;¡Ley y orden, por favor!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36611;Intriguing!;Curieux !;Fesselnd!;August Strindberg (1849-1912) fue una de las personalidades de más talento de la literatura mundial. Autor teatral, novelista y escritor de cuentos cortos, sus trabajos exhibían una furia y un genio que combinaban el naturalismo, la psicología y el misticismo. 'La cámara roja' le lanzó a la fama en 1879. Satirizó a las instituciones y la situación de Suecia de finales de la década de 1870. Strindberg, hombre polifacético, sentía un odio fanático hacia la mujer emancipada, sentía interés por la ciencia y el ocultismo ¡y también hizo sus pinitos en la pintura, la fotografía y la alquimia!;¡Fascinante!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36612;Yes, our defense must be strong!;Oui, nous devons nous défendre !;Ja, wir brauchen starke Verteidigungsanlagen !;En 1900, el parlamento sueco tomó la decisión de construir un vasto sistema de fortificaciones en Boden, cerca de la frontera con Finlandia. Construida en la cima de un peñasco con una situación estratégica cerca del río Luleå, y con un campo de visión excepcional, tenía como propósito vigilar el flanco norte y las riquezas naturales de la zona en caso de una agresión rusa.;¡Sí, nuestras defensas han de ser fuertes!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36614;Great stuff!;Un grand livre !;Toller Stoff!;Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, uno de los escritores más prominentes de Suecia y una de sus personalidades más complejas, tuvo un gran impacto sobre el desarrollo de la literatura sueca con una extensa producción literaria de obras en prosa que se caracterizaban por su romanticismo, su misticismo y su conciencia social. En 'Det går an' desafía las opiniones tradicionales sobre el matrimonio y el papel de la mujer en la sociedad. El libro causó rápidamente un escándalo.;¡Qué bueno!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36615;These are hard times indeed.;Les temps sont durs;Das sind wirklich harte Zeiten.;La década de 1880 fue mala para el sector agrícola. Si a eso sumamos una población en continuo crecimiento y un descontento cada vez mayor, estos problemas desencadenaron una ola de emigraciones masivas. Durante toda la década de 1880 se dio una emigración de familias a un ritmo preocupante. Más de 340.000 ciudadanos partieron hacia América, donde había más espacio y más oportunidades.;Sí, corren malos tiempos.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36616;Yes, accept the reform.;Oui, accepter la réforme;Ja, die Reform annehmen.;Siguiendo una propuesta de Louis De Geer, se decidió que el arcaico sistema parlamentario sueco, con sus cuatro estados de nobleza, clero, burgueses y campesinos, sería reemplazado por un parlamento compuesto de dos cámaras con los mismos derechos. A pesar de esta reforma liberal, la democracia aún estaba muy lejos. El sistema era injusto y creó una elite de prósperos hombres de negocios. Aquello dio lugar a un movimiento a escala nacional solicitando el sufragio universal para hombres y mujeres.;Sí, aceptar la reforma.;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36617;Give them the right;Accorder ce droit;Gebt ihnen dieses Recht!;Carlos XIV, rey de Suecia y Noruega, cedió ante las exigencias del Storting y permitió que los barcos noruegos viajasen bajo bandera noruega en todas las aguas del mundo.;Darles el derecho;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Su vía de expresión fueron una serie de reuniones entre estudiantes, la mayor de las cuales tuvo lugar en Uppsala en 1856.;¡Los pueblos escandinavos deben permanecer unidos!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36700;Hail the Lion!;Salut au Lion !;Heil dem Löwen!;En 1838, Hendrik Conscience (1812-1883), el novelista más popular del siglo XIX en el idioma flamenco, publicó una de sus dos obras maestras: 'De Vlaamse Leeuw' ('El león de Flandes'). La otra fue 'De Loteling'. La historia de la oprimida población flamenca que se enfrentó al opresor francés en la 'Batalla de las espuelas de oro' (1302) pronto fue adoptada por el movimiento flamenco y a día de hoy sigue siendo un símbolo para los flamencos.;¡Ave al león!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36701;New ideas are afoot!;De nouvelles idées circulent !;Neue Ideen sind im Anmarsch!;En 1847 tuvo lugar la formación del movimiento flamenco. El movimiento, constituido mediante un manifiesto, se convertiría en la voz de los habitantes flamencos de Bélgica. Evolucionó hasta convertirse en una aglomeración de distintas organizaciones flamencas: asociaciones deportivas, grupos musicales, teatros, organizaciones intelectuales, etc. Al principio, el movimiento era de naturaleza apolítica, pero, con los años, sus seguidores se volvieron cada vez más agresivos en sus creencias y convicciones. Posteriormente, el movimiento flamenco conduciría a la formación de, por ejemplo, partidos que presionaban pidiendo más derechos para los flamencos en la vida diaria política.;¡Nuevas ideas en marcha!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36702;We must help those suffering;Nous devons aider ceux qui souffrent;Wir müssen den Leidenden helfen!;Los años entre 1845 y 1850 se convirtieron en algunos de los peores para la población belga, especialmente para los flamencos. Los problemas empezaron en 1845, con la epidemia de la patata. Hubo que destruir decenas de miles de patatas infectadas. Eso condujo a un largo periodo de hambre y pobreza, especialmente grave en la parte rural de Flandes. Aquel trágico periodo se prolongó hasta 1850.;Debemos ayudar a los que sufren;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36703;Form the Association;Former l'Association;Verband gründen;Cuando, en 1846, se fundó la Asociación por el libre comercio (Association pour la Liberté Commerciale), Bélgica se encontraba aún bajo los efectos de la epidemia de la patata y la hambruna subsiguiente. Para asegurar que los alimentos alcanzasen a la población hambrienta, se abolieron las tasas aduaneras sobre el grano importado.;Formar la Asociación;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36704;Feel the vibes!;Bonnes vibrations...;Feel the vibes!;Adolphe Sax era un músico y fabricante de instrumentos de gran talento nacido en Namur, en el sur de Bélgica. En 1846 inventó el glorioso instrumento ahora conocido como saxofón. Éste fue adoptado rápidamente por músicos parisinos, y más tarde cruzó el Atlántico, donde hicieron buen uso de él en diversas bandas de jazz.;¡Qué vibraciones!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36705;Brilliant work;Beau travail;Hervorragende Arbeit!;Ernest Solvay (1838-1922) fue uno de los químicos de mayor talento de todo el mundo. Hoy en día, una de las mayores empresas químicas del mundo y la de mayor importancia de Bélgica lleva su nombre. En 1862, Solvay inventó el proceso del amoníaco (o Proceso Solvay) para la producción industrial de la sosa cáustica. En 1865 se inició la producción industrial del producto.;Un trabajo genial;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36706;A true humanitarian;Un grand humanitaire;Ein wahrer Menschenfreund!;En 1865, el padre Damián De Veuster, sacerdote de Tienen, en Brabante, fletó una nave hacia la isla de Molokai, en Hawai, para ayudar a la colonia de leprosos que allí había. Trabajó y vivió allí con los leprosos durante más de 20 años, hasta su muerte por esa enfermedad en 1889.;Un auténtico altruista;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36898;Victoria Regina!;Victoria Regina !;Victoria Regina!;;¡Victoria Regina!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36900;Reforms? Not sure we want those!;Des réformes... Je ne suis pas sûr qu'on en veuille !;Reform? Wer hat was von Reformen erzählt?;En 1836, los liberales, siguiendo el ejemplo de la fundación del Carlton Club por parte de los conservadores, fundaron el 'Reform Club', que se convertiría en el centro del liberalismo en el Reino Unido en las décadas venideras.;¿Reformas? ¡No creo que eso nos convenga!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36901;A touching story;Une histoire touchante;Eine ergreifende Geschichte;En 1838 se publica en Londres la novela de Dickens 'Oliver Twist'. En ella informaba de la pobreza y la ausencia de derechos de los trabajadores que había en esos tiempos.;Una historia conmovedora;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36902;I could use a vacation too!;Je prendrais bien des vacances, moi aussi !;Ich könnte auch Urlaub vertragen!;El impresor y predicador laico británico Thomas Cook llevó a cabo el primer viaje organizado por tren desde Leicester a Loughborough. Con precios bajos y el viaje, alojamiento y comidas incluidas, viajar se convirtió en algo posible para más gente que nunca.;¡A mí también me vendrían bien unas vacaciones!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36903;A glorious couple!;Un beau couple !;Ein glorreiches Paar!;El 10 de febrero de 1840, la reina Victoria se casó con su primo, el príncipe Alberto de Sajonia-Coburgo-Gotha. A diferencia de muchos otros matrimonios de la época, éste se basaba principalmente en su afecto mutuo, no en cálculos dinásticos.;¡Una pareja gloriosa!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36904;We'll keep an eye on them!;On va les tenir à l'œil !;Wir werden ein Auge auf sie haben!;En julio de 1841 se publicó el primer número de la revista 'Punch'. Con el tiempo se convertiría en la revista satírica publicada ininterrumpidamente durante más tiempo de la historia.;¡Tendremos que vigilarlos estrechamente!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36905;It's fun to be in it!;C'est bien sympathique !;Es macht Spaß beim YMCA!;George Williams fundó la Young Men's Christian Association en Londres en 1844.

EVTOPTA36906;I'm afraid we cannot help them!;J'ai bien peur qu'on ne puisse rien faire !;Ich fürchte, wir können ihnen nicht helfen!;En 1845, un hongo destruyó la mayor parte de la cosecha de patata de Irlanda. ¡Es inminente una hambruna!;¡Me temo que no podemos ayudarles!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36907;A scandal!;Quel scandale !;Ein Skandal!;En 1847, el escritor William Makepeace Thackeray publicó 'La feria de la vanidad', un escrito en el que criticaba el superficial y falso mundo de las así llamadas clases superiores.;¡Es un escándalo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36908;This will speed up communications!;Cela va accélérer les communications !;Dies wird die Kommunikation beschleunigen!;En 1850 se inauguró la primera línea de telégrafo entre gran Bretaña y el continente europeo.

EVTOPTA36911;Courage equal to desire;Le courage, c'est comme le désir;Mut ist gleich Verlangen;En 1893 se publicó el segundo libro de poesía de William Butler Yeats, 'La rosa'. A esas alturas, la suya se había convertido en una voz más que inconfundible, y su control sobre la métrica y la rima eran los de un genio. Yeats se encontraba desarrollando temas específicamente irlandeses e inició su larga asociación con los republicanos irlandeses, mezclada con un misticismo estético.;El valor equivale al deseo;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36912;Is the shipwreck then a harvest, does tempest carry grain for thee?;Je m'éveille et sens la chute des ténèbres et non le jour.;Ihre Ingestalt ist aus Kraft und Anmut gemischt …;Las obras completas de poesía de Gerard Manley Hopkins se publicaron póstumamente en 1918, pese a que el propio Hopkins se negó a su publicación en vida. La poesía presentó al mundo una nueva métrica conocida como 'sprung-rhythm' (ritmo saltado), que proporcionó un gran estímulo al creciente movimiento modernista. La poesía de Hopkins era modernista, pero al mismo tiempo se le considera un poeta religioso. Se convirtió al catolicismo en su juventud y fue estudiante y profesor de filosofía cristiana medieval.;¿Acaso es el naufragio una cosecha, acaso la tormenta acarrea tu grano?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36913;Another prestigious sporting event.;Un autre événement sportif prestigieux;Noch ein prestigeträchtiges Sportereignis;La reina Victoria inaugura el trofeo de la copa América, una competición para marineros de alta mar aficionados.

EVTOPTA36915;Three cheers for the Queen!;Trois hourras pour la reine !;Die Queen lebe hoch!;El sexagésimo año de Victoria en el trono fue celebrado con una enorme demostración de afecto popular. A esas alturas ya había vuelto a la palestra pública una vez más tras un periodo de aislamiento después de la muerte de Alberto, su marido.;¡Tres hurras por la reina!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36916;Repeal the Corn Laws;Abroger les lois sur le grain;Getreidekontrollgesetze aufheben;Introducidas originalmente para evitar una importación masiva de grano extranjero tras las guerras napoleónicas, las Leyes del Grano fijaban los precios de los alimentos básicos y las ganancias de los agricultores a unos niveles artificialmente elevados. En 1846, el gobierno conservador de Sir Robert Peel las abolió. Este acontecimiento significó el principio de la política de libre comercio inglesa que duraría hasta bien entrado el siglo XX.;Abolir las Leyes del Grano;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36917;To the peak!;Jusqu'au sommet !;Auf zum Gipfel!;El primer club de alpinistas del mundo se fundó en Londres en 1857.;¡A por la cima!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA36919;Let's get healthy!;Soignons-nous !;Hauptsache gesund!;Florence Nightingale es reconocida en todo el mundo como la fundadora de la enfermería moderna. El ministro de la guerra británico le asignó la tarea de supervisar la introducción de enfermeras en los hospitales para los heridos en Turquía durante la guerra de Crimea como 'enfermera jefe' de 38 enfermeras. El éxito de esta misión dio lugar a la creación de la primera escuela de enfermería en Inglaterra y la fundación de un programa para examinar la salud médica del ejército. Nightingale también trabajó en el campo de la salud pública, administración de hospitales y reforma sanitaria.;¡Apostamos por la sanidad!;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36920;Deny the Chartist Petition;Repousser la requête des chartistes;Chartisten-Petition ablehnen;Tras las leyes de Reforma de 1832, los miembros varones de las clases media y baja que seguían sin tener derecho al voto iniciaron un movimiento en favor de una mayor democratización de la constitución británica y sostuvieron que aquello supondría una mejora económica y social en las vidas de los trabajadores.;Rechazar la petición cartista;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36921;The unions look to Labour;Les syndicats ont les yeux fixés sur le parti travailliste;Die Gewerkschaften schauen auf die Labour Party;La Taff Vale, una compañía de ferrocarril galesa, frustró en 1901 una huelga en su contra apelando a la Cámara de los Lores, que permitió a la compañía presentar una demanda por daños y perjuicios contra el sindicato de trabajadores. Esta decisión supuso un duro golpe contra el sindicalismo y ayudó a lograr apoyos para el naciente partido Laborista.;Los sindicatos cuentan con los laboristas;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36922;Horrible!;C'est terrible !;Schrecklich!;En cariñoso recuerdo del cricket inglés, fallecido en el Oval el 29 de agosto de 1882.;¡Horrible!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36923;Man developing from apes? Ridiculous!;L'homme descendrait du singe... C'est ridicule !;Die Menschen stammen von den Affen ab? Lächerlich!;Basándose en las observaciones realizadas por él mismo durante su famoso viaje a bordo del Beagle, el científico Charles Darwin, publicó su obra 'El origen de las especies', en la que afirmaba que todas las formas de vida terrestres se habían desarrollado mediante un proceso de la ley del más fuerte, no mediante un acto de creación. Sus opiniones fueron rebatidas con vehemencia entonces y ahora.;¿Que el hombre procede de los simios? ¡Absurdo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36924;I say, anyone for Tennis?;Qui veut faire une partie ?;Hey, wer hat Lust auf Tennis?;En 1877 se celebró el primer torneo individual de tenis para hombres en el All-England Club, en Wimbledon. El ganador fue Spencer Gore. Los espectadores pagaron un chelín por cabeza. En la final hubo alrededor de 200 espectadores.;¿Le apetece a alguien un partidito de tenis?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36925;Repress these depraved criminals!;Réprimons ces criminels dépravés !;Unterdrückt diese verdorbenen Kriminellen!;El asesinato de al menos 6 prostitutas por Jack el Destripador, el más célebre asesino en serie moderno, horrorizó y conmocionó a la sociedad victoriana. Sin embargo, la consternación ante este horror tuvo el efecto indirecto de llamar su atención sobre la extrema pobreza y depravación que reinaban muy cerca de ellos, en las calles del este de Londres, sobre todo en Whitechapel, lugar en el que tuvieron lugar los crímenes. Aunque las autoridades estaban demasiado ocupadas intentando encontrar al psicópata, cosa que nunca conseguirían, los problemas sociales siguieron pesando en la conciencia de los ingleses durante los años venideros.;¡Que repriman a esos criminales depravados!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36926;Bravo!;Bravo !;Bravo!;La producción de Samuel Phelps de 'El sueño de una noche de verano' le ha devuelto la magia a Shakespeare. La sencillez de su producción ha demostrado que las obras dramáticas de calidad pueden tener éxito, y ahora parece que todas las compañías teatrales de Inglaterra intentan seguir su ejemplo.;¡Bravo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36927;Through the looking glass we go..;Un monde à l'envers...;;Charles L. Dodgson, bajo el seudónimo de 'Lewis Carroll', publica el primero de dos libros infantiles. Con ilustraciones de Sir John Tenniel.;Atravesamos el espejo...;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA36929;A tragedy!;Quelle tragédie !;Eine Tragödie!;Diecinueve meses después de su finalización, el puente sobre la ría de Tay cerca de Dundee se vino abajo a causa del fuerte viento. También se perdió un tren de seis vagones. El arquitecto del puente, Sir Thomas Bouch, fue declarado responsable y destituido de su puesto como arquitecto del puente sobre la ría de Forth.;¡Qué tragedia!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36930;Hurrah for the Taiping;Hourra pour le Taiping !;Ein Hurra auf die Taiping;Ha tenido lugar una gran carrera por traer el primer cargamento de té entre cuatro clíperes que zarparon de Fuchow a finales de mayo: the Fiery Cross, Ariel, Taiping y Serica.

William Morris ha roto con el 'lamentable estado en que se encuentran las artes decorativas en la Gran Bretaña' para crear un mobiliario de una hermosa sencillez.

EVTOPTA36933;Is so much sports healthy?;Est-il sain de faire tant de sport...;Ist soviel Sport gesund?;Con la creciente popularidad del atletismo, no era más que una cuestión de tiempo que se celebrase el primer campeonato inglés. A diferencia de los festivales de gimnasia en Alemania, lo más importante eran los éxitos individuales, no la celebración de la unidad (nacional).;¿Es bueno para la salud tanto deporte?;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA36934;An idea long since due;Il était temps;Das wurde aber auch Zeit;En parte como reacción al tremendo fracaso de los oficiales de la nobleza en la Guerra de Crimea, y en parte como reacción a una tendencia antiaristocrática, Gran Bretaña suprime en 1871 la costumbre de permitir la adquisición de cargos de oficiales. De ahora en adelante, los oficiales por lo menos tendrán que recibir una instrucción. Aunque el ejército se volvió más profesional, su tendencia de cargar ciegamente se vio ligeramente reducida, ante la consternación de algunos oficiales veteranos.;Una idea que debió aplicarse hace mucho;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

En ella comentaba la beligerancia y religiosidad de los americanos, algo que aún hoy sigue resultando un misterio para los europeos.

EVTOPTA37216;Let him rot on Devil's Island!;Qu'il moisisse sur l'Ile du Diable !;Lasst ihn auf der Teufelsinsel verfaulen!;En 1894, un espía francés descubrió una lista (bordereau) manuscrita en la embajada alemana con una relación de documentos militares secretos franceses. Las sospechas recayeron sobre el capitán judío Alfred Dreyfus, que fue declarado culpable por una corte marcial y condenado a cadena perpetua en la Isla del Diablo. Dreyfus proclamó en vano su inocencia.;¡Que se pudra en la Isla del Diablo!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA37217;J'accuse!;J'accuse !;J'accuse!;En 1896, el coronel Picquart descubrió pruebas que señalaban al comandante Esterhazy como el verdadero autor de la lista por la que había sido condenado Dreyfus, pero el comandante fue absuelto en una corte marcial que no duró más que unos minutos. En una carta abierta al presidente francés, Émile Zola acusó a los jueces que absolvieron a Esterhazy de haberlo hecho por orden del ministerio de la guerra. Posteriormente, en 1898, resultó que gran parte de las pruebas contra Dreyfus habían sido falsificadas.;J'accuse!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA37218;The affair is closed;L'affaire est close;Die Affäre ist abgeschlossen;En 1899, tras demostrarse que las pruebas contra Dreyfus habían sido falsificadas, su caso fue remitido a la corte de apelaciones. Luego estalló el escándalo, pues fue declarado de nuevo culpable por un tribunal militar, ante la negativa del sistema a admitir su anterior error. Aunque recibió el perdón del presidente y fue luego exonerado en 1906, el resultado de todo el asunto fue un aumento del anticlericalismo y el antimilitarismo, y la unificación de la izquierda francesa.;Caso cerrado;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA44100;Well then I'll go to Hell!;Bien, qu'il aille au diable !;Na dann zur Hölle mit mir!;Mark Twain edita en 1885 'Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn', que supuso una revolución total de la literatura americana de ficción. Hasta su publicación, la literatura de ficción americana había tendido a utilizar la forma y el lenguaje de sus predecesoras europeas. Mark Twain rompió una lanza en nombre de la independencia lingüística al utilizar el lenguaje de los analfabetos y americanos de condición humilde. El libro constituía un claro intento de mostrar que la gente de toda condición es merecedora de respeto en base a sus actos y no a su clase social. En su momento causó un escándalo debido a su estilo poco convencional, y, por lo general, su mensaje fue ignorado. Incluso hoy en día hay gente que no se da cuenta.;¡Bueno, pues entonces iré al infierno!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Su nominación es vista por los empresarios del norte como un intento de sabotear a los acreedores y romper los cárteles.;No crucificarás a la humanidad en una cruz de oro;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44103;It is right and proper to return it.;Il est juste de le rendre.;Es ist richtig und angemessen, es zurückzugeben.;Encuentran a la deriva el HMS Resolute en el Atlántico Norte, tras haber sido abandonado por el escuadrón en busca del explorador polar perdido Sir John Franklin.

EVTOPTA44107;The law is the will of he whom the sheriff will obey.;La loi, c'est la volonté de celui à qui obéit le shérif;Das Gesetz ist der Wille desjenigen, dem der Sheriff gehorcht.;Oliver Wendell Holmes publica en 1861 'El derecho consuetudinario' una historia de la tradición del derecho consuetudinario. En este libro afirmaba que la ley no era algo lógico, sino más bien la voluntad del juez templada por las circunstancias, o, como rezaba su máxima más conocida: 'la vida del derecho consuetudinario no ha sido lógica, sino experimental'. Se convirtió rápidamente en un clásico, Holmes accedió a un puesto de profesor en Harvard al año siguiente, y acabó formando parte del Tribunal Supremo de los Estados Unidos. La publicación de 'El derecho consuetudinario' fue un síntoma del auge del pragmatismo entre los intelectuales americanos, y presagiaba una creciente desconfianza del moralismo tras la terrible masacre de la Guerra Civil.;La ley es la voluntad de aquel a quien obedezca el sheriff.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44108;I must have them!;Il me le faut !;Das muss ich lesen!;Ulysses S. Grant publica sus memorias, en las que relata casi toda su vida. Escribió el libro estando enfermo de un cáncer de laringe, para intentar mantener a su familia después de su muerte. Considerada universalmente una obra maestra de la literatura americana, las memorias de Grant se caracterizan por su sinceridad, claridad y economía de estilo. Mark Twain las comparó favorablemente con los Comentarios de Julio César. Las memorias fueron un éxito fenomenal en su momento y siguen siendo uno de los pocos libros que no han estado descatalogados en ningún momento desde la Guerra Civil. Probablemente sea el mejor libro escrito por un presidente americano.;¡Tengo que comprármelas!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mantenidas por el Tribunal Supremo en varias sentencias claves a lo largo de la década siguiente, estas leyes continuarían existiendo en diversas formas hasta ser anuladas medio siglo después. Durante la primera guerra mundial, los 166 miembros de los comités ejecutivos de la Internacional de Trabajadores de la Industria serían arrestados y juzgados, hundiendo al sindicato para siempre.;Es una traición atacar al propio país cuando éste empuña la espada;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Pese a sus protestas de inocencia, Macdonald se vio obligado a dimitir como primer ministro. La falta de confianza de Donald A. Smith en Macdonald sólo sirvió para impulsar el declive de la popularidad del partido.;¡Macdonald debe dimitir!;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44301;Listen to the Métis demands;Écouter les revendications des métis;Forderungen der Métis anhören;Los mestizos eran una agrupación de pequeñas comunidades de ascendencia mixta francesa e india de la región de Manitoba que tenían esperanzas de autogobierno. Por desgracia, sus sueños se vinieron abajo cuando el territorio de la Bahía de Hudson del que formaban parte fue entregado a Canadá sin su consentimiento. Como protesta, los mestizos se sublevaron al mando de Louis Riel. Louis Riel era un hombre profundamente religioso que estudió para sacerdote en su juventud. Luchó por los mestizos y fue considerado un héroe a ojos de la gente de Manitoba. Louis negoció con el gobierno canadiense el ingreso de Manitoba en la confederación. Los delegados canadienses aseguraron que se respetarían los derechos de la gente. De este modo nació la provincia de Manitoba.;Escuchar las peticiones de los mestizos;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44302;The Métis are up in arms;Les métis ont pris les armes;Die Métis haben sich bewaffnet;Aunque el gobierno canadiense prometió respetar los derechos de los mestizos, no parece que fuera así. Las peticiones de los mestizos de que sus posesiones e instituciones fuesen reconocidas se desoyeron. Los mestizos también se sentían cada vez más disgustados ante la invasión de sus territorios por un creciente número de colonos procedentes del este. A principios de 1885, la situación estalló cuando los mestizos volvieron a tomar las armas y se rebelaron. Adoptando el 'Proyecto de ley revolucionario', los mestizos establecieron su propio gobierno, independizándose de Canadá. La rebelión fue aplastada por las tropas canadienses. Louis Riel fue juzgado y ejecutado. Los mestizos tardarían cien años en ser reconocidos oficialmente como pueblo.;Los mestizos están furiosos;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Considerable effort was put into circumventing sanctions, and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons, with the help of several different sources; these sources allegedly include Israel. The term "front-line states" referred to countries in Southern Africa geographically near South Africa. Although these front-line states were all opposed to apartheid, many were economically dependent on South Africa. In 1980, they formed the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa. Many SADCC members allowed the exiled ANC and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to establish bases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This set off a wave of Shi'a reprisals against Sunnis followed by Sunni counterattacks. The conflict escalated over the next several months until by 2007, the National Intelligence Estimate described the situation as having elements of a civil war. In 2008 and 2009, during the Sunni Awakening and the surge, violence declined dramatically. However, low-level strife continued to plague Iraq until the U.S. withdrawal in late 2011.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The insurgency was a direct continuation following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. After the U.S. military's withdrawal, the level of violence rose, as Sunni militant groups stepped up attacks targeting the country's majority Shia population to undermine confidence in the Shia-led government and its efforts to protect people without American backup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Alternatively we could remove the monarch from its influential position within the government, making it possible for the monarchies to remain at their regional level and only performing formal roles if they wish so, but angering those who would have wished to see the monarch remain as an influental person within the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

We have the choice of Amsterdam, a city with a seaport connecting it to the North Sea and the Alantic Ocean, strategically located if for any reason the government would have to go in exile again. Secondly there's Brussels, conveniently located in the middle of the Benelux union making it easy for any citizen to visit if they would wish so, the city is also mostly evenly populated by both Dutch and French speakers making it a perfect fit for our capital to located. Then there's Luxembourg City, relatively small compared to the other two cities, but its location is near the border of both Germany and France which for future affairs could be a nice gesture for co-operation, strategically having our capital so close to our border would be a bad idea though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7000003_DESC;Before the formation of the Benelux Union can be finalized, there's still some formalities that should be taken care of. One of them is the question of how we will be represented on the international sports stage, since we have moved on from a simple nation-state to a union of three of them. We have several options to consider. On the one hand our country could be presented participating as a single nation in sporting events. On the other hand we could take an approach similarly to the United Kingdom and have our country represented as a whole in major events, while having individual representation for the more minor sporting events. Alternatively we could have it completely decentralized and keep our original form of sports representation in which all nation-states will act independently, but that will hurt us on the international stage making our union seem more like one in name only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Once the operation succeeded in its goal through kidnapping of major Ciskei government figures, such as Sebe himself and his son, the two homelands were meant to be merged into a new state called Xhosaland, that would have beneiffted of East London as a Free Port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC5073;In 1986 and 1987, Transkei, a larger, wealthier and more populous entity, undertook a series of military raids on Ciskei and attempted to seize control of Ciskei. One of these raids was an attack on leader Lennox Sebe's compound, with the apparent goal of taking him hostage, in order to force a merger of the two Bantustans. Transkei had previously granted sanctuary to Lennox Sebe's estranged brother Charles, the former head of Ciskei's security forces, who had been imprisoned in Ciskei on charges of sedition, and kidnapped Lennox Sebe's son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Violent protests immediately broke out following President Mangope's announcement that Bophuthatswana would boycott the South African general elections.
