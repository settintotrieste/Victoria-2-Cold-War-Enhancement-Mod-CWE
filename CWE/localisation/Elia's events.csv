EVT_8020346_DESC;On the path of Pescara and Reggio, L'Aquila has also took the streets protesting the decision from the regional junta to share the regional capital between Pescara and L'Aquila. The revolt started during the junta's sitting, in which as soon as the motion was pushed forward, coins started being thrown to the speaker, bringing the junta to announce the session paused even tho it was actually finished and had passed. Out of the building a mass of people booed the politicians and on the following day city strike was called, the strike quickly got violent, destroying the party Headquarter of all institutional parties except for the MSI and the house of the city mayor was taken assault. On the third day tensions dissipated as PCI's Pietro Ingrao held a speech in the city calling for unity, but the issue is still hot and further parliamentary acts will have a crucial role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020347_DESC;The recently formed Centrist government has entered a crisis following minister's Giovanni Gioia (DC) decision to ban private cable TV. The decision came after a long period of discussion about TV. Since the limited introduction of colour TV, the mediatic question has been the major argument in the chambers. First clashes came when minister Gioia representing the ruling DC announced that, after a period of testing, colour TV will be introduced nationwide, while PSDI ministers pushed for the new technology to be used only for important events as the PCI lead a campaign against the introduction, deeming it a useless consumer good, and the PSI backed the DC. Later developments pushed the Communications' Minister to ban private TV to ensure a regulated introduction. This move has proved itself controversial, gaining critics from PSI's Bettino Craxi and prompting the PRI to threaten to withdraw confidence to the government if Gioia isn't sacked. If we don't stand back it is very likely that the President of the Republic will inquire Mariano Rumor to form a quadripartite government with the Centre-Left formula, either Prime Minister Andreotti can sack Gioia and integrate the PRI into the ruling coalition, assigning them the Communication's Ministry. Sectors on the right also push for a controversial move, change the PRI for the MSI-DN, and secure a Centre-Right government standing on their controversial support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020348_DESC;Following the formation of the latest Andreotti government, the Prime Minister has had to resign from his place citing the protests from within the party and the ruling coalition, with the PSDI withdrawing support when MSI-DN's votes turned decisive in the last parliamentary meeting. Forced to abdicate, Andreotti is far from having left the arena, with the help of DC veteran Guido Gonella, he has been vying within the party to play the factions to secure a single party government headed by Gonella and with outsider support from the PLI and the MSI-DN, maintaining the Centre-Right shift. Shall he fail in this task it is very likely that Moro and Fanfani's factions will be able to instate the "organic" Centre-Left with Rumor at its head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020349;Coming off a troubled legislature, this year's elections, finally a regular one, lay their destiny in the hands of the PSI. The leadership of the Socialist Party, having long abandoned the projects of unification with the PSDI, has to take a vital decision as no majority will be able to be formed without their support. Will the Socialists shake once again hands with Berlinguer and the PCI, forming a Left Alternative, or will the PSI manage to sway the DC to their cause forming a left of centre coalition that will be able to enact quick policies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020350_DESC;After having succeeded Rumor at the lead of the Centre-Left, Aldo Moro has managed to lead two governments this legislature, keeping at bay PSI's ambitions. Lately the uneasy compromise has broken up following PSI's Secretary Francesco de Martino decision to withdraw support wanting early elections. Under his leadership the PSI has been vying to closer collaboration with the PCI and trying to make it backtrack from its "Historic Compromise" strategy, mending the 1956 split. An option to avoid this event has luckily presented, Prime Minister Moro, the man behind the "Historic Compromise", could form a single party government with outsider support from the PSDI, PLI and PRI, re-launching Centrism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020351;As PSI's De Martino cuts the head of a chaotic legislature, the medias keep their eye on PCI's Chairman Enrico Berlinguer. The political forces of the whole spectrum have acknowledged the continued growth of the PCI and decided that the time had finally come to come to terms with this italian anomaly. Two options arise, the Historic Compromise and the Left Alternative. To most a Historic Compromise sounds like the most obvious choice, former PM ALdo Moro and Berlinguer have been keeping in contact for a long time and the National Convention of the DC gave the greenlight on his strategy, that would bring the PCI into the constitutional arc and set the basis for a Grand Coalition based on the german model. PCI's Hardliners and the PSI on the other side hope for a change in strategy that will finally bring the PCI and the PSI once again together and finally in power, putting an end to decades of DC rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The train was traveling from Rome to Munich; having left Florence about 45 minutes earlier, it was approaching the end of the long San Benedetto Val di Sambro tunnel under the Apennines.

The bomb had been planted by neo-fascist Ordine Nero (Black Order) as a revenge for the killing of one of their members by left wing terrorists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020353;Held in Berlin, at the Interhotel Stadt Berlin, after months of delay, the Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe, signed a turn in the world communist movement. The Soviet CPSU had been pushing for years for the meeting to help strengthen the movement and their position in the world but the conference only helped its weakening. What was meant to be a reconciliation meeting turned into the manifesto of a new communist left, the so called Eurocommunism, a development of marxism in Western Europe adapted to the current liberal-democratic order, spearheaded by Spain's PCE, France's PCF and with Italy's PCI at its helm. During the Conference Finland's SKP, Sweden's VPK, San Marino's PCS and Great Britain's CPGB joined the Eurocommunist camp, while ruling SKJ and PCR, respectively from Socialist Yugoslavia and Romania, also showed sympathies for the anti-Soviet camp. The meeting officialized the position PCF's George Marchais, PCE's Santiago Carrillo and Italy's Enrico Berlinguer had been formulating through various conferences and official visits, beggining Europe's new reformist turn in the communist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020354_DESC;What the PCI has been fearing since the disarmament of the Garibaldi Brigades in 1945 has finally happened, as soon as they democratically got into power a chain of command with links throughout the military and the secret services has activated to stop communists' road to power. Troops have already mobilized, but luckily the PCI benefits from infilitration into a few key institutions and genuine popular support, the coup leaders will not take power without a fight. Nonetheless the PCI also benefits from a secret paramilitary organization that had been trained with SOviet support to resist situations like this, the paramilitary oganization has also been instructed to protect communist leadership and activists by arranging safe trips to Moscow, where those exiles will be welcomed by the PCSU's brotherly arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020355;The no compromise line taken by both the DC and the PCI has proved itself disastrous, after 55 days hostage and several police searches, Aldo Moro's body has been found with 12 shots on the back in a car in Via Caetani, exactly on he road that from Piazza del Gesù (Where the DC Headquarters lay) leads to Via delle Botteghe Oscure (Where the PCI Headquarters lay). The death of 61 years old stateman signs a black day in the history of this republic and a turning point in her politics, with Moro gone the Historic Compromise will hardly be respected under the gegemony of Giulio Andreotti, factional rival of the deceased, who is seen by many people as the archtect behind this kidnapping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020356;The PSI's appeal to negotiations has proven victorious, after having paid an egregious sum of money, the Red Brigades have released Aldo Moro on the outskirts of Rome, where an exchange was mediated by the armed forces. The statesman has now been greeted by the family and the citizenry that has gathered in the city centre to celebrate the release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020357_DESC;Backlash against the Historic Compromise has surged within the ruling DC after the death of Aldo Moro. Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti has angered the PCI by allowing anti-Compromise ministers into his government and as the nation mourns this national tragedy the PCI has found itself eager to have a role in this governement and threatens to lead the country to early elections if they don't get integrated into the current government. The situation seems clear, either a Grand Coalition lead by Andreotti supported by most constitutional arc parties, or early elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020358;After Andreotti's refusal to allow ministries to the Communists, the nation has found itself facing early elections. The electorate seems to favour the "secular parties" (PSDI, PLI, PRI) over the traditional forces, that for many are comsidered the cause of Aldo Moro's death. The failure of the Historic Compromise has left the DC and the PCI in a situation of crisis and the gamechanger seems that will lay in those third parties. Necessarily the PSI will have to take part in the government, but will the 'secular parties' be strong enough on their own to close the PSI to the position of an outside supporter or will they triumph over those parties and give legitimacy to the former Organic Centre-Left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020359;The failure of the Centre-Left has lead to a rightwards shift in the public opinion that has scared many on the left. The boiling topic of this election is the MSI-DN, will they provide a useful ally or will that cause national uproar? The DC can only expect to outcomes, shall the MSI-DN prove itself a democratic force an "Organic" Centre-Right will find its road to power, will they not, many sectors within the ruling DC have been arguing for a renewed Centrism in the vein of the 1950's Centrism but with more partecipation from the 'secular parties' (PSDI, PLI, PRI).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_80203060_DESC;9 Years after the 1968's protests, the student's contestation has found a new path. What has been described as the '77 Movement has quickly gained the media's attention. Following the 1969 education reform, University has become accessible for all classes and what used to be a upper middle class movement has turned into a popular movement, animated by the lower stratas of the population. The '77 Movement is characterized by their allegiance to non-parliamentary politics, mainly on the field of the far-left, represented by organizations such as Lotta Continua (Continued Struggle) and Autonomia Operaia (Worker's Autonomy), a new form of feminism and violence in their protests, that has often turned into terrorism.

The incident resulted in the highest known exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in residential populations, which gave rise to numerous scientific studies and standardized industrial safety regulations.

The police seems to follow the line of a terror attack, waitimg for rivendications and searching for explosive devices on the plane, while rumors from the Quirinale hint that the plane may have been destroyed during a dogfight between Libyan, French and American jets, probably during a punitive expedition against Libyan Ras Muhammar Gaddafi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020362_DESC;After 35 days of strike by blue collar workers at the FIAT Mirafiore factory in Turin, a mass of 12.000 white and blue collar workers took the streets to protest against the strikers, who made it impossible for them to go to work. Entered history as the march of the 40.000 due to journals early reporting, the underlying causes can be found in the firing of 14.000 workers by the company, that had been living a profound crisis since the 70's. The trade-unions quickly came in help to the striking workers and the PCI made it a personal battle, with prominent members and even the leader Enrico Berlinguer visiting the workers and holding speeches, but after a month of inactivity the burden of the strike begun to show its effects and with politiciaztion by government parties, a counter-protest was indicted by a citizens' committee in support of the workers that want to work. This is the first great blow to the PCI's hegemony over he working class throughout the 70's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020363_DESC;As the PSI closed its 42th congress the situation has finally matured to allow them to join the government without reserves. The DC's left wing and Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga see this as an occasion to enlarge the government's position and wish to see a second mandate for the PM, but Andreotti's right-wing faction seeks to not alienate the recently re-alligned PLI and instead vye for a new Centrist coalition that will include all the secular parties blocking off the PSI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020364_DESC;Following a police raid at Licio Gelli's Villa Wanda and Giole factory in the Arezzo province, in Tuscany, during an anti-mafia operation, a list of over 1000 incripts to the Freemason Lodge Propaganda 2 (shortened to P2) was found. The list included many relevant public figures an politicians, among them PSI's Minister for Foreign Trade Enrico Manca and DC's Labour Minister, names of important enterpreneurs such as Silvio Berlusconi and generals like Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa and Vito Miceli (who also was a deputy for MSI-DN) but even former king Umberto I's son Vittorio Emmanuele. Alongside the list were found tapes of interviews to lodge leader Gelli about what was called the Plan of Democratic Rebirth, a conspirative draft for the reforms to enact in order to control Italy. Following the revelations a parliamentary and legal inquiry led by former catholic partisan Tina Anselmi was formed and now the government has entered a crisis due to the ties found with the lodge. President Pertini and much of the parliament wish to see Forlani gone to avoid any controversy, and according to the late president a situation arises to leave for the first time the prime ministership to a non Christian Democratic politicians. Sandro Pertini, a PSI member, has long tried to break the DC hegemony, going as far as handling an explorative mandate to republican Ugo la Malfa in 1979, and today another republican was considered, Giovanni Spadolini. But a few voices within the ruling DC and PSDI have been arguing for the formation of a new Forlani government with the exclusion of the indicted ministers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020365_DESC;The Second Spadolini Government, or as the media dubbed it the "Photocopy Government", recently entered a crisis due to the personal fight between the Treasure and the Finance Ministers. The government came to be after the fall of the First Spadolini Government, the first lead by a republican and by a non-DC politician, due to the right sector of the DC striking down a few reforms, but the PRI quickly managed to form a new government consisting of the same majority and with the same ministers, hence photocopy, after meetings with the DC. The fight, commonly known as "Lite delle Comari" (The gossip fight), erupted when the two ministers, PSI's Rino Formica and DC's Beniamino Andreatta, found themselves disagreeing on the handling of the separation of the Bank of Italy and the national treasure. The mutual separation had been proceeding with no interference from the parliament and the Spadolini govermnet had long been damaged by this, but the situation reached critical levels when answering to Formica's plans to reimburse quotas of the treasure through an extra-judicial pact with the Bank, lead by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Andreatta called the socialist minister and his party "nationalsocialists". This accusation disturbed the whole political spectre, as nazism is still a fresh memory for most italians and many in the PSI even fought in the resistance, and quickly lead to more personal insults. Ultimately the parties of the two ministers have took the stance to not take part in any government where those ministers are present. Two situations arise, Spadolini could lead a third government with new ministers, but the political establishment pushes for DC veteran Amintore Fanfani to lead a comrpomise government that can mend the conflicts between the parties, as Spadolini clearly proved himself unable to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020366_DESC;Since the fall of Spadolini II a uneasy atmosphere has been plaguing the ruling majority, with Bettino Craxi's PSI having grown decisive and determinated to premiership. At their last party meeting, the socialists decided to send the country to early elections by withdrawing their support from the current ruling coalition. Taking advantage of the new political climate and the victories in parliament of his party, Craxi believes that he can lead the party to be the first socialist Prime Minister in the history of the country, but there is a factor he hasn't considered, rising DC star Ciriaco De Mita. Currently the general secretary of the Party, De Mita is a proponent of the Historic Compromise, tending to appease the PCI and seek their help over the PSI's. Shall he be able to strike a deal with the Communist Central Committee, a centrist government supported by the PCI's outside support might be able to save the country from early elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020367;Having succeeded in his goal, PSI's Bettino Craxi now leads the negotations table at the general elections. It is clear that every government will have to include the socialists, but two options arise, one on the left and one on the right. The socialist leader seems to favor an alliance with the DC, PSDI, PLI and PRI, maintaining the Pentapartito formula inaugurated by the Spadolini government, where the socialists would be able to get premiership and lead the nation until the next elections. On the left instead the PCI, after having dropped the Historic Compromise due to its failure after Aldo Moro's death, has been pushing a new strategy of Democratic Alternative, a leftist coalition including all progressive forces within the country, among them the hard left DP (Proletarian Democracy), a party born out of all the social movements arose in 1968 and 1977.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020368;As elections approach two possible coalitions open up for the ruling DC, both on the vein of the revent right wing shift. On one side there is the New Centrist formula, where the "secular parties" will have a bigger share of power, or the Organic Centre-Right with the participation of MSI-DN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020369;Highly anticipated, this year's elections will prove themselves decisive for the course of the new decade. The voters will be called to the ballots to express their judgement on the Historic Compromise, and if the results turn out positive for the PCI and the DC the second phase of the pact will finally begin, with PCI's full entrance into the government coalition and the country's parliamentary politics, crowning Enrico Berlinguer as the most influential man in republican history. Shall the voters express disappointment, it is possible that the DC will seek a renewd Centre-Left agreement with the socialists and the secular parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020370;The end of the first non-DC lead legislature has finally come and elections approach. The DC has been lacerated by internal fights since Spadolini first held premiership and now De Mita and the party establishment have found themselves at odds. The party's General Secretary wants to renew the Historic Compromise with the PCI, taking advantage of the shift of balance of powers in Italian society and sidelining factions to the right and to the left; but many within the White Whale (Nickname for the DC) wish to give the Republicans another chance, using their leadership as an excuse to gain hegemony over the various factionalisms, by forming a government with the other secular centrist forces and sidelining the PSI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020371;On the 14th of February $YEAR$, hence the nickname Saint Valentine's, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi promulgated a decree cutting the sliding wage scale short of three points to face the economic crisis begun in the 70's. The sliding wage scale was a system negotiated by the trade unions in 1945 and fully expanded in 1975 thanks to the effort of the CGIL, CISL, UIL Federation that ensured the workers the ability to negotiate their wages on a fair ground and based on global economic changes. The decree signs the second setback of the worker's movement since the 40,000 march of 1980 and can be identified with a larger movement of reflux into public life and to the right that has marked the turn of the decade. Although the decree is a law as of now, the parliament will have to approve it or it will decay after 60 days, will the decree be turned in a law-decree the PCI has swore to lead a protracted campaign for its abrogation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020372_DESC;Following the approval of the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, the CGIL, CISL, UIL Federation has broken down due to the secret deals striked by the CISL and UIL with the government regarding the sliding wage scale and the CGIL's opposition to the government's maneuvre. This signs another big defeat for the worker's movement as the Federation had came to be following the Hot Autumn of 1969 and for more than a decade represented the united will of the working class, that today finds itself fractured just as it did in the immediate post-war, when the CISL and UIL split from the then hegemonic CGIL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020373;As expected the PCI pushed forward a motion for an abrogative referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree. Now that the referendum has to be held all the responsibility rests on the voter, who, if they shall vote no to the abrogation, will show to the PCI that their time is soon to be over. The PCI has in fact put a lot of pressure and energy into this project and shall they loose it would be a huge blow to their public image and electoral performances, but on the other side that would be a huge victory for the PSI and its leader Bettino Craxi, who has set himself the goal to reform italian society bottom-up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020374_DESC;Having lost the $YEAR$'s Abrogative Referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, PSI's leader Bettino Craxi has had little to do but resign from his position as Prime Minister, hoping for the president to dissolve the chambers and calling early elections to find  anew guide for the country, but DC's new charismatic leader has been considering the formation of a coalition with the PCI in the vein of the Historic Compromise until the end of the regular legislature. What will happen in either case cannot be predicted, the only thing that can be known for sure is that Craxi and his new Socialist Party will need years to regain the momentum they had managed to gain before those tragic results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020375;Following defeat at the ballots during $YEAR$'s Abrogative Referendum on the Saint Valentine's Law-Decree, PSI's leader Bettino Craxi resigned from his premiership and the president Sandro Pertini dissolved the chambers calling early elections. The absolute defeat of Craxi's reformists has paved the way for the rise of the PCI and the return of the Historic Compromise: the two most possible outcomes seem indeed a DC-PCI Grand Coalition in the vein of the Historic Compromise or PSI's eclipse from parliamentary politics will be able to open the path for Andreotti's Centrist cabinet, thanks to the exodus of votes from the PSI to the secular parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020376;Between the 13th and 16th of October $YEAR$ the local juntas of Turin, Pescara and Rome shut down the transmission from Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest channels Canale 5, Italia 1 and Reete 4. According to the magistrates the private company was streaming illegally by using video tapes to which the state had not given authorization. Following the judges' actions, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, a friend of Berlusconi, quickly drafted three decrees (Berlusconi first, bis and ter) to make the streaming legal once again. Needing prime minister's decree the parliament approval or else they decay after 60 days, the parliament will have to decide if the measures will stay leaving the road open for private media or if to reimpose state control over transmissions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020377;On the 7th of June $YEAR$, PCI's Chairman Enrico Berlinguer, as he was holding a speech in the city of Padova ahead of the incoming European Elections, was hit by a stroke, but neverthless continued to address the rally while the people there kept asking him to stop. Soon he was brought to his hotel room where he fell asleep on the bed and entered a coma, just to die in hospital on the 11th. On the 13th of June the funeral was held in the city of Rome, attended by over a million people and many relevant public figures such as President of the Republic Sandro Pertini and even MSI's leaders Giorgio Almirante and Pino Romuladi, ideologically opposed to the late PCI leader. The procession started in Via delle Botteghe Oscure, where the PCI headquarters lay, and went on to San Giovanni Square, showing the support the city had always had for the chairman. Shortly after his death Alessandro Natta, a longtime ally of Berlinguer, was elected as leader of the Italian Communist Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020378_DESC;The first socialist-lead goverment in the history of the republic has recently fallen due to various contesting issues between the DC and the PSI. It has reached public attention that in 1983 prior to the elections the DC and the PSI had found an agreement, the so called relay agreement, that would guarantee that for in exchange for a PSI Prime Minister, a DC Prime Minister would take over halfway during the legislature, to then renew the pact during the next elections. Craxi has on his part not showed any willingness to respect the agreement and the DC answered by not voting in favour of the PM's last decrees. The pact those is far from having been forgotten and Craxi could be able to gain some more time to enact it negotiating with the DC's Right-Wing of Andreotti, while De Mita and the rest of the party hope on the pact to be respected and a new Fanfani govenrment to lead the nation until the end of the legislature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020379_DESC;As Craxi managed to hold on one more year, the tensions within the Pentapartito have really reached te boiling point and the DC will not accept one more socialist government. If Craxi won't fall in line to the pacts there will be little to do but call early elections, in that instance the DC has already consulted the other parties for the formation of an electoral government under Amintore Fanfani that can deal with the bureaucratic issues until the chambers are officially dissolved. If PSI's inner contesting voices will though be able to make themselves be listened by their leader, there is hope that the relay agreement will be respected and Arnaldo Forlani will cleanily succeed Bettino Craxi as head of the Pentapartito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020380;As expected Fanfani managed to prepare the country for elections just before having had his government fail at the confidence vote, which ironically saw full support by the PSI, PSDI and PR (Radical Party) and opposition by the DC that voted in block against. The new President Francesco Cossiga could do little but dissolve the chambers and call early elections, the first that will expect a vast number of non-traditional parties enter parliament. In fact the Federation of Green Lists and the Lombard League, respectively an environmentalist and an autonomist movements, are expected to enter the two chambers while the Radicals are expected to grow their consent. Nonetheless the DC is expected to still come out on top while the PCI to loose to the PSI, who under Craxi's premiership largely increased their electoral successes. If everything goes as polls show, the only thing left to the future is who shall come on top of this new edition of the Pentapartito, that is assured to get a majority. The main contenders are Giovanni Goria representing the leftist factions of the DC and Giulio Andreotti for the right, only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020381;The first season of the Pentapartito has come to its end as the legislature closes and the polls show great successes for this new political formula. Having the relay pact been respected by Craxi's socialists, now the negotiations between the five ruling parties have begun ahead of the new electoral successes. Some argue for the first half of the legislature to be continued by the DC and that seems the most likely outcome but PSI and PRI leaders have been voicing their opinions asking for a new term in their hands, to then give the premiership once again to the christian democrats by the end of the legislature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020382;During the Paris Peace Treaties negotiation a clause for which it was ensured that Italy should have never really had resources independence was added. The clause also assured that Britain would have kept a monopoly in the Mediterranean, but since Enrico Mattei was made administrator of italian ENI, this balance has been upset. Enrico Mattei's policies have angered many at the pentagon with his firm opposition to what he calls the "seven sisters", the 7 biggest oil trusts in the world, including our Standard Oil of New Jersey, Mobil, Chevron, Gulf and Texaco and his closeness to third worl liberation movements. Under his influence Italy has moved dangerously close to the Arab states, which it financed publically and risks not only to sabotage our economic interests in the region but even to slip out of our sphere. After a quick meeting with the british MI6 officials it has been agreed that this man has to go, but to do so a presidential approval is needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020383;The start of the Six Days War between Israeli and Arab-Egyptian forces has started a great debate in our ruling cabinet. Under the influence of Enrico Mattei and his third world enterprises, foreign minister Amintore Fanfani has long been pursuing, both as PM and as minister, a pro-Arab policy, in defiance to NATO official politicians. This pro-Arab policy has been dubbed by the White Whale (The DC) as neo-Atlanticism, aka the support of Arab states to keep them away from sliding into Soviet hegemony, but renewed conflict and american support for the israelis has lead to a turning point. If we want to keep pursuing this neo-Atlantic policy there is no choice but to withdraw from NATO and pursue an independent foreign policy while not cutting diplomatic nor economic ties with the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020385;The time has finally come to pass the premiership once again to the DC, but it will not be as easy as expected. The DC has been undergoing factional struggles ahead of the relay and once again the left and right factions have come on top, on one side Giovanni Goria, a member of the young generation of the party, on the other Giulio Andreotti, longtime factional leader and former prime minister. So before any decision shall be taken, various rounds of consultation between the parties and even more among the factions shall take place to allow the relay pact to come into effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020386_DESC;The De Mita Government, formed after the fall of the first Goria Government that fell due to already resolved issues between the coalition members, has recently been attacked by Bettino Craxi's PSI, that after his re-confirmation as party leader in the last PSI Congress, has formed a pact with DC rightist leaders Arnaldo Forlani and Giulio Andreotti to bring down De Mita and his faction. The pact which in the media has been dubbed CAF (Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani), is set to bring to power Giulio Andreotti in exchange for a later possible PSI premiership, while isolating the centrist and leftist factions of the DC. Only one alternative seems to arise, as proposed by PSI's third in command Rino Formica, a possible National Unity Government headed by compromise figure Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that will use the PCI to counterbalance the socialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020387;Following a historical victory in the last elections, the PCI has decided to take the zeitgeist and enlarge the ruling coalition by turning the Left Alternative into a Democratic ALternative, that can include even more democratic forces. The PCI is planning on ruling again alongside the PSI and with the new support of DP (Proletarian Democracy), representing the branches of the population to the left of the PCI, but hopes to be able to include regionalist and more moderate elements to be able to bring about better results. But while the PCI is confident of its strength, the PSI might turn of them if the polls don't show broad support for the former goverment, and could break the process of re-unification by forming yet another alliance with the DC and the Centre-Left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020388;As a result of the recent economic policies the Italian GDP has reached a historical high, surpassing the UK in what has been called "il Sorpasso" (the surpassing). Italy has such benefited from becoming the 6th economic power on the world stage and the 5th in the capitalist block behind the US, Japan, West Germany and France, enjoying more international prestige brought by the "Made in Italy" mark and a second italian miracle. After the stagflation of the 70's Italy has finally seen a new golden age, social life has returned to good levels and citizens have never been as rich, it is truly a good time to be italians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020389;Today voters will be called to the polls for a new general election. This year the hottest issue is the renewal of the Historic Compromise, will the PCI and DC renewed path together be approved by the voters, or will they flock to third parties, re-inforcing the Right DC opinion of the need for a New Centrism, closing the Historic Compromise window and return to their traditional allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020390;A new electoral season inaugurated by the Right's successes has opened and a new player joined the game. The MSI-DN and the PLI, after recent collaboration, have decided to initiate a confederational experiment, in what they call the Right Cartel. Alongside rightist elements of the DC, this new political element, that will take the name of DN (National Right), has decided to came down to agreements with the DC to allow for one of its members, Raffaele Costa, to become the new prime minister shall the voters wish so. But to this proposal a counter-proposal has arisen among christian democrat more moderare voice, that will try to form a coalition of Centre-Left parties to counter this experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020391;After a long political journey begun in 1989 with the XVIIIth Congress of the Italian Communist Party and that ends today with the XXth Congress, the PCI has entered a new phase and abandoned its historical role as a marxist party, changing emblem and becoming the Democratic Party of the Left. After a long period of decadence begun with the 40.000 march at the turn of the last decade that saw costant decline in polls and failure in various referendum and law proposal, the PCI, under its new leader Achille Occhetto, a member of the younger generation of the party, has decided to embrance the position of a social-democratic party that could, alongside the PSI, constituite a great left wing, democratic and european opposition in the parliament. The reformist turn had initiated after the XVIIIth Congress and the Bolognina turn of 1989, when chairman Occhetto spoke of a "New PCI". A great debate has since ensured among the party ranks, between who supported the turn and who supported the heriatage of the PCI and wished to maintain it, tensions exacerbated during the preparations of the XIXth Congress, when supporters begun to publically harass reformist leaders and blocked communications through the PCI hotline phone number. Although the voter's resistance at the congress 67% of the Party voted in favour of the change, prompting many to leave. The last straw is happening right now, as the Occhetto motion wins at the XXth Congress and the Cossutta motion (in favour of the old PCI) leaves the party to found a new marxist formation, the Communist Refoundation Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020392;This year's election are set to take place in a very different situation from any previous election since 1948. Since the start of the Mani Pulite pool investigations, the public opinion has greatly turned against traditional parties and new forces are set to make great advances. Lega Nord, a broad coalition of regionalist and federalist regional leagues, including the Lombard and Venetian Leagues that in 1987 entered parliament, and La Rete (The Network, whose full name is Movement for Democracy - The Network), a progressive movement born out from the Sicilian DC with a great emphasis on combating mafia, have rapidly been making gains respectively in the north and in the south of the country. As if it wasn't enough the Pentapartito fell down after the inauguration of Giulio Andreotti and at the polls this years presents itself a smaller Quadripartito composed by the DC, PSDI, PLI and PSI, since the PRI left the coalition over a fight of ministries. Although the Quadripartito seems to be the most likely option a smaller faction of the DC headed by Mariotto Segni, son of former Head of State Antonio Segni, is bringing forth the possibility of a technocratic goverment to enact fast reforms in the country, supported by the DC, the PSDI, the PLI, the PSI, the PRI and La Rete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020393_DESC;The victory of the Mattarellum, long fought against by the socialists, at the $YEAR$ Abrogative Referendum have left little to do for Prime Minister Giuliano Amato but to accept the defeat and resign. Considering the recent political instability given by a series of scandal brought about by the Mani Pulite pool, a tacit agreement between most political forces, from the Quadripartito to PDS' former communists, the FdV (Federation of the Greens) to the PRI and AD (Democratic Alliance), has found its way among the parliament, hinting of a possible technic's government headed by former Bank of Italy leader Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, which would also entail many non-politicians among its ministries, to enact quick reforms. On the other side an unlikely coalition kept together by PSI's Bettino Craxi, who has recently lead a charge against the government trying to get the premiership back, has been trying to form within the parliament. Craxi has managed to get under his umbrella the secular parties (PSDI, PLI and PRI), Bossi's Lega Nord, La Rete, FdV and even the neofascist MSI-DN in hope of restructuring this country, but this coalition's success lays on the bet that a few tens of DC members will abstain from voting against.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020394_DESC;Having been sworn in by less than 10 hours, the Ciampi goverment faces already great responsibilities, the process of socialist leader Bettino Craxi. Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Mani Pulite pool, has recently asked the parliament to remove Craxi's parliamentary immunity to have him attend a process against him and his party, accused of embezzlement and corruption. The goverment and the parliament are now set to vote on whetever to authorize the pool or not, and the PDS and the FdV have already threatened that if the vote will save Craxi, they'd withdraw support from the government, ending their short collaboration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020395_DESC;Due to the political instability of the current republic and how the current electoral system has proved itself inefficient in giving fast answers to actual issues, a referendum on a new voting law was indicted by Mariotto Segni's Democratic Alliance and Pannella's Radical Party. In conformation to italian law the referendum will only be able to abolish the current law, while the new one would have to be approved by the parliament at a later date. The new electoral law, which was dubbed as "Mattarellum", from the name of its theorizer Sergio Mattarella, but that for many deserves the nickname "Minotaur" for its chimeric form, will change the chambers costitution by turning 75% of the constituencies from Proportional to First Past the Post, while in the senate the remaining 25% will be assigned through the scorporo, a mechanism for which the most voted non elected members would get a seat, while in the chamber of deputies the 25% will be assigned through a classic proportional system. The law will also include an electoral threshold of 4% of the votes, whereas earlier you needed 300.000 votes. Against the Referendum only Craxi's PSI and the MSI have took a solid stance, while most of the parliament has supported the initiative or remained apathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020396;On the 17th of February $YEAR$, in Milan, judge Antonio Di Pietro, after having obtained a mandate, arrested PSI's member Mario Chiesa as he was trasportig a kickback for public work given by enterpreneur Luca Magni (Who was the one who denounced Chiesa, sick from paying the politician). Chiesa was caught thanks to a hidden microphone hidden in Mafni's jacket and as soon as the news became nationwide PSI Leader Bettino Craxi, who was campaigning for the incoming elections, denounced the case as an isolated one, and called Chiesa a villain. After a few turns of interrogations Chiesa confessed that the kickback had become a tax needed to participate in any government and that all government parties, including the PSI, were full into the corruption system, contradicting Craxi's declaration. With the help of Chiesa's wife the Mani Pulite pool (Clean hands pool), the pool that leads the case headed by Di Pietro, has found the names of other corrupted politicians, and from them other names and so on. With many politicians getting indicted trust in the parties has been reaching historical law levels, with Di Pietro being hailed as a hero, the Dc shrugging off the investigations, Lega riding the wave to gain more votes and Craxi denouncing the judge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020397_DESC;The victory of the Mattarellum, long fought against by the socialists, at the $YEAR$ Abrogative Referendum have left little to do for Prime Minister Giuliano Amato but to accept the defeat and resign. According to the pacts signed by the Right DC and the PSI an easy transition to Christian Democratic rule under Arnaldo Forlani shouldn't be a hard task, but on the other side of the parliament an unlikely coalition headed by Bettino Craxi, who has recently lead a charge against the government trying to get the premiership back, threatens the Quadripartito and the CAF. Craxi, defying the earlier agreements, could manage to get under his umbrella the secular parties (PSDI, PLI and PRI), Bossi's Lega Nord, La Rete, FdV and even the neofascist MSI-DN in hope of restructuring this country, but that will rely on tens of DC members abstaining from voting against the new goverment. The future of the country is in the hands of Craxi, who shall decide whetever to stick to the pacts or force his hand into a new coalition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_8020398_DESC;As the Tangentopoli scandal ravages the country, the use of illegal funds to finance the secret services has came to public attention and threatened the government as Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi defended the President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro when he was asked to resign. Unluckily now Ciampi is under fire and all parties have turned against him, prompting for a quick solution to the issue. Many seem to wish for a round of early elections, so to unlock the blocked legislature to the changes caused by recent political instability, but on the other hand, Mariotto Segni, who in the meanwhile has left the DC to found his own Patto Segni (Segni Pact, shorthand for National Rebirth Pact), has proposed to lead a coalition of DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI, his own party and the Lega Nord to quickly enact reforms to fix the current situation of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020399;The first to be held with the new electoral system, this year's elections mark the end of what has been called the First Republic, and the beginning of a second republic. For the first time we see an election marked by the establishment of two different coalitions running against eachother similiarly to how it plays out in the USA or the UK. The forerunner are on the left Achille Occhetto, former leader of the PCI, the architect behind its transformation into the PDS (Democratic Party of the Left) and the current leader of the Alliance of Progressives and of the PDS. The Alliance of Progressives is a left wing broad front formed by 8 parties: the PDS at its head, the PRC (Communist Refoundation Party, usually shortened to just Refoundation), a political party born from the ashes of the former PCI by members who refused to accept the dissolution of the party, the Social Christians, a humanist and left wing splinter of the former DC (Which has recently become the Italian People's Party, PPI for short), the FdV greens, La Rete, a much smaller PSI and its splinter RS (Socialist Rebirth). On the other side of the spectrum we find instead enterpreneur Silvio Berlusconi, who thanks to a small trick, has managed to form a strong front on the Right. Berlusconi was candidated as its leader by two different coalitions, the Pole of Freedom and the Good Government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020400;The voters will today once again be called to the ballots to decide the fate of their country. The options seem once again to burn down on the PCI or the Centre-Left as government allies for the ruling DC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020401;Due to the series of victories by the PCI, this year's elections seem to propose a degree of polarization never seen before. The PCI is once again running on a Democratic Alternative platform alongside the PSI and the DP, but the Right has revently been making comebacks and to avoid this outcome the DC has had little to do but to firm a Centre-Right coalition with the PLI and the MSI-DN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020402;Another elections round approaches and once again the PCI is running on its Democratic Alternative platform with PSI and DP, but the centrist forces, under the umbrella of the DC, have found once again unity, hoping to stop the successes of the communists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020403;Today voters are called to the polls to decide whetever to give the Government the ability to amend the constitution to enact the reform drafts recently shown to the public. The voters will vote on the sinle issues, deciding where to give the government confidence, in the first constitutional referendum ever held in the country. The Referendum includes three motions, each regarding a different sector of the reforms: Motion 1 regards the new administrative asset pushed forward by the PCI and regionalist parties, Motion 2 regards healthcare and benefits from the support of the PCI, PSI, DP, PR and PSDI while Motion 3 regards the chambers and is supported only by the PCI. We shall see if the Communists will be able to solve the contradictions of this Republic or if they will fail like many have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020404;After the historic rightwards turn of the country following last elections, the ruling Centre-Right coalition has suffered great losses due to the student's movement that's been trying to shift the country left and don't tolerate the presence of neo-fascists in the ministries of the Republic. The students have polarized public opinion after various clashes with the police and right wing counter-protestors, and the participation of the MSI's students' wing to these clashes has turned the DC to consult first her former goverment allies, the PSDI, the PLI and the PRI. But shall those consultations end badly there shall be little choice but to hold onto the MSI once again, proceeding in a right direction, but maybe the PSI could come in handy to stop this tide and turn the country back to her anti-fascist roots, forming a Centre-Left coalition as tried in the late 50's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8020405;The victory of the Right at last elections has quickly lead to the evolution of the MSI into a new political body. Ahead of today's elections Giorgio Almirante, MSI's leader, has brought under his umbrella the PLI and the PDIUM (Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity, successor of the PDI), beginning what he called the National Right. The unification of those parties into the new MSI-DN signs a new period of the Right Wing in Italy, under Almirante his party has managed to get more relevance among moderates, presenting itself as the vanguard of common sense and order during the chaos of the student's movement. Alongside the DC the new MSI-DN has formed a Cartel of the Right, hoping to restore order, stability and prosperity, but shall the voters be threatened by this outcome, maybe the Centre-Left could really be the only way to achieve such prosperity and stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
