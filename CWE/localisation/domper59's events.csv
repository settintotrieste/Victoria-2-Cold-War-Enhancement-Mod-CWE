EVT_9001023_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in $CAPITAL$, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress during Leonid Brezhnev's leadership of the Party and state. This Congress will provide places for personalities in key positions, such as Brezhnev, Kosygin and others. But it is important on because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters, with a large majority, proposes to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, there is an alternative proposed by Cybernetics, that of automating the Soviet economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001024_DESC;Not surprisingly, Liberman's reforms were chosen. This would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set a price and a salary, to hire, to order...). It will be first experimented in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant at the beginning. However, this reform meets resistance from conservatives, such as Leonid Brezhnev, because it requires the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and fears that this will lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges. Should you fully adopt Liberman's Reforms or make a compromise and adopt it partially?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001025_DESC;It was with surprise that Victor Glushkov's ideas resurfaced. Cybernetics is far from unknown and the project of automating the Soviet economy already dates back to Stalin's time. But the party seems to have realized the full potential of this project that could move the Soviet Union in the field of science and computer science ahead of the West and may well save the country in the future. The CPSU has already released money to generalize computers. It remains to be seen whether we want partial or complete automation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001027_DESC;In order to greatly improve the access and organization of our economy, it was decided a few years ago to introduce computers massively. This first step was reached and it became common for the Soviets to work with computers, no matter how big they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001033_DESC;We have just passed a new milestone, an automated calculation system has been created in order to reduce falsifications and better organize working time. This is the core of the OGAS project...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001034_DESC;We have managed to install a computer network to link our computers to better communicate information across the country and allow acceleration in the field of research. This is already a great leap forward for the West. Our economy is now much easier to manage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001070_DESC;In March 1956, rallies took place in Georgia, especially in its capital, Tbilisi. Demonstrations took place to denounce Khrushchev's speech, many of the demonstrators were Stalinists, but also nationalists, who saw Stalin as an icon of their national identity. Now, strong demands are said, such as the independence of Georgia or a radical change of the central government in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001071_DESC;Stalin's legacy has always been a problem in the Soviet Union, especially for the ruling class, and has had many reactions and consequences in the socialist camp. Today, the question is still raised, some radicals would like to establish a real cult for Stalin, to see him above all as the one who turned the country from a backward nation into a world power or a figure of anti-fascism. Others, more moderate and conservative, would like to create a commission to judge Stalin's role for the country (Stalin made mistakes, but above all he had an important role for the country). And finally, more "reformist" people would like to denounce Stalin in all aspects and concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In order to bring us closer to China, the Secretary General can appointed a new Foreign Minister: Oleg Troyanovsky. He is a very experienced diplomat who served as ambassador to Japan. If appointed, he shall have the heavy task of trying to bring the Soviet Union and China closer together. This decision initiates a chain of events that can end the Sino-Soviet Split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001074_DESC;Our delegation has just arrived in China to try to settle our differences. It may not be easy but not impossible. The first subject of division is political: the Soviet Union and China considered themselves, since the de-Stalinization, as the true Marxist-Leninists and accused each other of Revisionism. Do we stay on this position, do we try to compromise or do we admit our mistakes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001075_DESC;Now that the political issue has been settled, we must now be clear about our attitude towards Western Imperialism, especially the USA. Indeed, especially since the Cuban crisis, China accuses us of being too soft on the Americans. Should we maintain Khrushchev's position, engage in a discussion by putting forward a pragmatic diplomatic policy, or should we assert our hatred against Western Imperialism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001076_DESC;And finally, the last subject of discord between the USSR and China is a border problem. The region has always been a source of conflict but has become so since the Sino-Soviet breakup. Should we maintain the official line, try to calm things down with the negotiation of a treaty, or should we cede territories to China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001077_DESC;Despite attempts at reconciliation, the meeting ended with an incomprehensible volley of personal and political insults. Our divisions have deepened and it's going to take some time before it calms down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001079_DESC;It's done! We have managed to find a compromise for everyone so that we can re-sign a Friendship Pact between our two countries. Although there are still differences between us, our two great countries are together again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001081_DESC;It's a general surprise! The American president visited Mao, in China. What little hope we had of re-establishing relations with China has been extinguished !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001082_DESC;Our leader has just made contact with the Soviet Union. The purpose of this visit is to bring us closer together, and perhaps one day to re-establish relations as before the Sino-Soviet split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001085_DESC;Although our relationships are not as radiant as we would like them to be, our leader has managed to find some form of restoration in our relationships. This is a great day for China and for Socialism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001086_DESC;In order to bring us closer to China, our Secretary General has appointed a new Foreign Minister, Oleg Troyanovsky. A very experienced diplomat who served as ambassador to Japan.

EVT_9001087_DESC;After several months of negotiations and disagreements between our two countries, it seems that we have reached a balanced agreement. Now is the time to find out if we can become friends and even brothers again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001088_DESC;Thanks to the efforts of Oleg Troyanovsky, China has agreed to reconcile with us. The two leaders met in Beijing to sign a friendship pact! This is very good news for the socialist camp, not so good news for the West. The socialist camp has been strengthened by a strong ally, and the two big brothers can finally stand next to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001089_DESC;Despite Oleg Troyanovsky's efforts, China refused to reconcile with us. One thing is clear from now on, we can never be friends again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001035_DESC;On May 18, 1967, Yuri Andropov became head of the KGB. He established the principle of socialist legality, which definitively broke with Stalinist methods of arbitrariness. Very marked by his experience during the Prague Spring, he embarked on the path of reformism and began to attempt reforms to try to save the Soviet Union. He is considered, in hindsight, as the father of Perestroika and Glasnost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001036_DESC;Fyodor Kulakov, Secretary of Agriculture of the Central Committee and potential successor of Leonid Brezhnev, is a very important reformer (he is the mentor of a certain Gorbachev). The Soviet Union has always had agricultural difficulties and Kulakov is studying in a very active but secret way the experiences that are being made in Hungary and Yugoslavia. He seems to want to introduce a decentralized management of collective farms and state farms, create agricultural cooperatives based on the family contract and the farm individual. We can use this as a pretext to eliminate it politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001037_DESC;Peter Masherov, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus and a veteran of the Partisans, has, since his appointment in 1965, achieved important developments in this Republic by increasing the national income of Belarus and enabled industrial and agricultural development. However, Masherov attracted the thunderbolts of many party members as he renewed the Communist Party of Belarus and had conflictual relations with the party ideologue Mikhail Suslov and was also very close to the disgraced Kulakov. However, Leonid Brezhnev is counting on him to replace the former head of the Council of Ministers, Alexei Kossygin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001038_DESC;Dinmukhammed Kunaev, was the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and had the particularity, unlike other secretaries, of being of Kazakh nationality. He was a very close friend of Brezhnev and succeeded in developing Kazakhstan by developing the mining, raw materials and energy industries. However, a commission for the creation of an autonomous region for the German population, composed among others of Yuri Andropov, is very badly regarded by Kunaev and he is tempted to provoke riots with the Kazakh population in case this autonomy is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001039_DESC;Shortly after the departure of Leonid Brezhnev, the Eighth General Directorate of the USSR on the orders of the 1st Vice-President of the General Committee, Semyon Tsvigun, disconnected the communication from the government, thus completely isolating the Secretary General from any information. With the help of the opposition in the KGB, Mikhail Suslov and Vladimir Scherbitsky quickly convened an emergency plenary session of the Central Committee, in which Yuri Andropov was accused of "using the power of the KBG to prepare a Coup, of being a spy at the service of the West" and so on. Yuri Andropov tried to retaliate, but after Vladimir Scherbitsky's speech, accusing him of planning to assassinate Brezhnev, he realized that he had lost. The Committee adopts the decision to remove Andropov from all posts, banish him from the Party and arrest him. The new President of the KGB begins a massive purge of Andropov's staff and to replace them with more suitable employees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001040_DESC;For the last two years, Brezhnev has been nothing but a figurehead. His health deteriorated during the winter of 1981. During this time, the country was ruled by Vladimir Scherbitsky and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine took decisions himself, so much so that Kiev had become the new capital of the USSR. The question of Leonid Brezhnev's succession was no longer a problem now that the reformist threat had been eliminated at the root. Rumors say that the Secretary General has already told me in confidence that he can now die in peace. His death heralds the end of one era and the beginning of another for the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001041_DESC;In the struggle to improve the economic situation of the state, Andropov began with a large-scale campaign to strengthen labor discipline. At the same time, high-profile corruption cases were triggered and a fight against unearned income and speculation was declared. The fight against commercial abuses became widespread. During the years of Andropov's reign, the number of persons convicted of criminal offenses increased significantly. Andropov began a "purge" of the party and the state apparatus, including the security organs. At the beginning of 1983, Andropov instructed Gorbachev and Ryzhkov to start preparing an economic reform, the word of Perestroika began to be used and was later taken over by Gorbachev. One does not know, however, the exact content of this reform even though she knows that it was much less radical than what was done afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001043_DESC;The greatest scourge of the Soviet Union is certainly its corruption. In order to curb it, Shcherbitsky carried out anti-corruption investigations, but not against the people, but against important members of the Politburo and other political bodies of great importance. Rarely, some of these trials even received media coverage. A major purge seems to have begun, but the targets are party cadres this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001044_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge now attacks the administration of the state. The population and even the whole world seems to finally realize that something is changing in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the conditions for entering the bureaucracy have been broadened in order to hire people on their skills. Of course, the party makes sure that all these people remain loyal to the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001045_DESC;In order to ensure the loyalty of the party and to fill the vacant positions, the General Secretary has appointed a new Second Secretary. He will make sure that the new politburo members are young and, above all, loyal to the new leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001046_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge seems to be over and a strict protocol was put in place to check the loyalty, competence and non-corruption of its members and can affect anyone. Even General Secretary Shcherbitsky was affected by his investigations and published the results in Pravda. Yet, although the main figure of reformism in the USSR has been eliminated, Gorbachev stands out and manages to gather a small faction within the party. He poses no threat to the future of the country because Gorbachev has neither the position nor the skills to conduct an effective opposition policy. It remains to be seen whether one wishes to eliminate all opposition or simply leave it in its corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001048_DESC;The economy of the Soviet Union has been stagnant for several years and economic reforms are needed. With his administrative talents, Vladimir Shcherbitsky began to undertake economic reforms that focused on the well-being of the population and better organization of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001049_DESC;In order to better organize the Soviet economy, a proposal is increasingly making its way within the Politburo: the partial automation of the economy. Although this does not please one part of the party, it would facilitate and simplify the organization of workers by improving the quality of goods. But only the Secretary General can decide to adopt this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001050_DESC;To conclude the economic reforms and still with a view to reform the economy of the USSR, Vladimir Scherbitsky organized a special meeting with the various leaders of the Eastern bloc to strengthen economic ties between the communist countries. This should lead to an economic boom in the whole region and greatly help the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001064_DESC;While small political reforms are underway, debates are taking place within the party as to whether more power should be given to the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest legislative institution. Some members of the party would like, under Leninism, to see the Supreme Soviet become a true legislative body, in which laws would be discussed by the party in this assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001065_DESC;A new question arises with regard to the place of the media. Should we always keep a control on the media by influencing them, in order to avoid the spread of any anti-Soviet propaganda, or do we give them frankly more freedom to let the people express themselves as they wish ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001066_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. It is the turn of the Syndicate to undergo a new debate in the party, should we give more power to opposition syndicates in the name of individual and collective liberties or do we always keep some control over them by influencing them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001067_DESC;The question of nationalities within the Soviet Union has always been a thorny issue. The problem is still present and is even growing and could lead to problems. Should we just repress its movements and monitor them closely or should we stop this policy of Russification of peoples and recognize the true equality of peoples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001068_DESC;A new congress begins today, but not an ordinary one, because it is broadcast live on Soviet television and shows a new face of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the various reforms of our leader, the USSR has been able to evolve while remaining faithful to the principles of the Communist Party. The Soviet Union seems to stand, more stable than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001069_DESC;Comrade Vladimir Shcherbitsky, General Secretary of the CPSU died, leaving behind him a Soviet Union stronger internationally, was able to reorganize the country's economy while getting rid of corruption. Whatever happens, the whole country mourns a great man and even countries, such as China or other communist parties, which had stopped being loyal to the USSR, came to bid him a final farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001090_DESC;Comrade Viktor Grishin, leader of the Soviet Union, has died. He was throughout his life a convinced Brezhnevist and continued to apply his policy when he took power after the death of Chermenko. The country is no longer as stable as when he took power, and the economic power of the country has become even weaker. The rise to power of the Reformists became inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001092_DESC;The election of Grigory Romanov as Secretary General was made possible by the support of Andrei Gromyko. Without this, the reformist Mikhail Gorbachev could have obtained the post by taking advantage of the confusion of Chermenko's death. This is proof that Gorbachev's supporters only want power and not the success of the communist cause, so it is essential to get rid of them as soon as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001094_DESC;In order to ensure that he would never again be subjected to this attempted takeover by the reformists, Grigori set up a system of ideological examination within the party to make sure that every member was a convinced communist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001095_DESC;Well aware that the bureaucracy has taken too great a place in the country and that it no longer relies on their achievements. The General Secretary Grigory Romanov begins to put more discipline, people are chosen for skills and employment in the party and in the administration is no longer guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001096_DESC;The question of nationalism has always been a problem for the USSR. In recent years, nationalism seems to be starting to gain strength again. Faced with this problem, we can either stifle them again or ensure the equality of peoples through political reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001097_DESC;Soviet Jews, deemed "cosmopolitan," were considered a security risk or potential traitors. Some were arrested, or punished in other ways, for daring to express a desire to leave the country for the West, which was seen as a confirmation of suspicions about their lack of loyalty. However, with the assumption of power by Grigori Romanov, who was a notorious anti-Semite, discriminatory and stigmatizing practices for this people could reappear. It remains to be seen whether the Secretary General will put his opinions aside or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001098_DESC;Grigory Romanov was certainly in favor of reforming the Soviet economy, but had a different vision from other party members. Indeed, in addition to wanting to improve the management of the party, he wanted to set up an automation of the country. The problem was the courage to find enough support in the party, the administration and the army to ensure such an undertaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001106_DESC;In the same way as in Leningrad, Grigory Romanov started to build scientific complexes all over the country in order to help the economic development of the country but also to help in research and try to catch up with the accumulated technological backlog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001107_DESC;Paradoxically enough, while many people see the new Secretary General as a tough person, some concessions of censorship in the creative sector are made. This resulted in the creation of new music clubs and filmmakers became freer to experiment with new genres.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001099_DESC;It is time to examine the situation with COMECON. To ensure the loyalty of its countries to the Soviet Union and its interests, a meeting will soon be held to decide which way to go: Should we use the COMECON to the advantage of the USSR by forming an economic union, which would make the Eastern countries dependent on us, or should we take the example of the European model, with the creation of a central bank and everything that can go with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001102_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. Despite the discontent of some people in the party, he managed, thanks to the automation of the economy, to reform and modernize the Soviet Union without its collapse. He did not stop protecting the interests of the Soviet Union, and increase its economic power and the welfare of the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001103_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. However, despite his good management, both internally and externally, the economic and political situation of the country has improved but has not solved the problems. His death announces the return to power of reformists who want to make reforms as Andropov or Gorbachev had done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001104_DESC;Andrei Gromyko never really liked doctors. Already in 1986, after a serious flu illness and a developed intoxication, Gromyko suffered a clinical cardiac arrest and managed to be brought back to life in extremis. However, the pain that the General Secretary has seems more serious and he might not survive if nothing is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001105_DESC;July 1989, Gromyko, not wanting to disturb his sleeping relatives, endured a sharp pain in the chest until the morning and by the time they realized it, it was already too late for the doctor and the General Secretary died suddenly while still reforming the Soviet Union. After a farewell ceremony was held to pay tribute to him as a respected Secretary General and diplomat, a new meeting to choose a new leader was held. Two candidates claimed the position: Mikhail Gorbachev, a reformist and several times pretender to the post, and Egor Ligachev, a former ally of Gorbachev, but with Gromyko in power, he was able to show notable differences between them, especially on the economic level, making him a moderate reformist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001108_DESC;With the aim of modernizing the Soviet Union by introducing liberalism. Andrei Gromyko presents a new economic form called "Planned Economy with Market Elements". Contrary to what one might think, this is not a policy like in China with Deng Xiaoping, but a new practice that consists of keeping the Soviet economic system (planned economy) but the government will now allow the population to own their small business, still controlled by the state, and even to be able to direct a small profit. The goal is to give more economic freedom to the population and to the government to find money easily while trying to scuttle the black market that reigns in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001109_DESC;Several months after the launch of this concept, we can see that Gromyko's goal is being accomplished. Small and medium-sized enterprises began to flourish all over the Soviet Union. Certainly, a minority within the party and the population demanded more freedom, but for the vast majority of the population, the fact that they could own a small business and make a living from it while having the comforts offered by the Soviet government made the measure very popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001110_DESC;Today, the government announced new economic reforms to make the Soviet regime more flexible. Its first announcement is on price policy. Indeed, as the Soviet Union is a planned economy and the vast majority of needs are provided by the state, the currency was not really "conventional" money and was not even used for exchange even within the country. Should we set up a currency that is always under our control but that can fluctuate according to the demand or should we go further by starting to control only the first necessities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001111_DESC;It is time to decide on the policy we have with the workers. Should we formalize Andropov's policy by disciplining workers by ensuring the quality of their work that they are all sufficiently competent and useful for the country in the position they occupy or should we go further by declaring that the workers are free, which would involve introducing notions that were unknown to the Soviet people such as the labor contract and etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001112_DESC;And finally, trade policy. It is above all a question of knowing how much we want to open ourselves to the world: a selective protectionism, although we are open, the importation of foreign product, especially those of the capitalists, will be overtaxed or a limited protectionism where our openness to the world is. larger and more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001113_DESC;A news has just been announced with surprise. In coordination with the USSR and all the countries of Eastern Europe, it was decided to open the borders with the communist countries and to set up an immigration quota for the outside. Looks like the Iron Curtain is starting to open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001114_DESC;In order to facilitate economic exchanges between communist countries, some people have hypothesized the creation of a central bank to better control our monetary policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001115_DESC;With the reform of COMECON into an economic organization standardizing the economy of all the countries of Eastern Europe with the USSR, we will henceforth be able to trade among ourselves and ensure certain forms of economic stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001116_DESC;After the successful implementation of economic reforms by the Gromyko government, it is high time to tackle political reforms in order to liberalize the Soviet Union and to give it a more human face on the international level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001117_DESC;The first reform that is on the table is the reform of the legislative policy. Although there is a parliament (Supreme Soviet), it is in fact controlled by the Communist Party, and they make the laws in the whole country. Does the Party still have this privilege or is the legislative power returned to the Supreme Soviet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001118_DESC;This issue is likely to be a little more thorny, that of elections. Theoretically, elections existed in the USSR, but it was only a fa√ßade. This time it is a question of how far we want to go with these elections: Does the Party let the people choose their candidates or do we hold contested elections within the Party?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001119_DESC;A new thorny issue will take place, it is the issue of freedom of the press. Even if the Secretary General wants to grant more freedom, he has not necessarily indicated how far he wants to go. Some members want to continue to control the media while others want to grant more freedom but make sure that no anti-revolutionary propaganda is published.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001120_DESC;The influence of the army in the Soviet economy has always been very large, and conscription plays an important role in it, since every man of age to enlist in the army for at least 2 years. To symbolize the decrease of the influence of the army, the General Secretary made the proposal to reduce the duration of conscription. However, some proposed to stop the military service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001121_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. However, still in this desire to liberalize the country, the question is how far we want to go with the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001122_DESC;The Soviet Union has many ethnicities which has always been a problem for the country and has always applied, as under the Russian Empire, a Russian-speaking policy to try to assimilate all its people. In recent years, however, more and more inter-ethnic conflicts, should we stop this Russian-speaking policy and really apply an equality between the peoples or do we change nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001123_DESC;Today, an important event took place. Indeed, the Supreme Soviet has just adopted a new constitution, called $YEAR$ Constitution, and it grants a little more political, economic and societal freedom but still reminds the central role of the Communist Party in its institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001124_DESC;Comrade Andrei Gromyko, General Secretary of the CPSU, has just died of a heart attack. His death was considered inevitable for a long time but he managed to live long enough to modernize the Soviet Union without adopting radical reforms. The country still seems to be stable and still holds a prominent place as a superpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001125_DESC;After long debate within the Party to determine the liberalization of the country's economy, the proposal of Gorbachev (Perestroika) was not retained, deemed too radical, in profile of that of Ligachev. From now on, the government announces the return of the NEP. The state will allow the population to create small or large enterprises in specific areas and will also encourage self-management of enterprises. This policy is criticized by some conservatives and the General Secretary recalled that even Lenin had temporarily given in to capitalism in order to revitalize the Soviet economy. It remains to be seen whether this policy will be effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001126_DESC;Many companies have been opened very quickly throughout the country, the benefits to the state has also increased ... However, many people have also made a lot of profit from this policy to the extent that they are beginning to have political clout. Some people even talk about the birth of an oligarchy within the Soviet Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001127_DESC;After the introduction of liberalism in the Soviet Union under the government of Ligachev, it is time to start political reform of the country and give it a more human face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001128_DESC;Surprisingly enough, General Secretary Egor Ligachev announced his resignation on television, explaining that his departure is above all a political rather than a forced retirement. The situation of the Soviet Union is not brilliant, the attempt to return to the NEP, with the establishment of cooperatives and a strong decentralization has caused the emergence of an oligarchy and the decline in the production of consumer goods. His attempt to open up the political scene allowed people like Boris Yeltsin to enter the legal opposition, which further weakened the unity of the Party. Although Ligachev more or less controlled the situation, economists warn that a major crisis is possible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001129_DESC;On August 17, members of the GKChP met in $CAPITAL$ and studied the treaty document. They believed that the pact would pave the way for the breakup of the Soviet Union and decided that it was time to act. The next day, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and General Varennikov visited Gorbachev at his dacha in Crimea in the hope of persuading him to declare a state of emergency and "restore order." In the end, the meeting came to nothing, Gorbachev will conclude it by saying: "Go to hell, do what you want. But report my opinion!". On August 19, at 1 am, Gennady Yanayev signed the decree on the entry into office of the President of the USSR and of the State Committee for the State of Emergency, composed of Yanayev, Pavlov, Kryuchkov, Yazov, Pogo, Bahlanov, Tizyakov and Starodubtsev.  It is time to launch the loyalist troops, but the question remains how to deploy the army.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001130_DESC;The troops were positioned as we wanted them to be, even though we encountered unexpected problems such as the population not openly supporting what was seen as a Putsch, everything went as planned. However, Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the KGB, has just learned from the Alpha Group that Boris Yeltsin was leaving his cottage for $CAPITAL$ to gather his supporters to fight the attempted coup.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001131_DESC;Around 11 am, on the Square of Manage, people with tricolor flags and portraits of Sakharov and Yeltsin begin to gather. Deputies and the $CAPITAL$ City Council call for an unlimited strike. Since we control the TV center, maybe we should use it to try to calm down the crowds.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001132_DESC;A press conference was organized in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, composed of Yanayev, Baklanov, Pugo, Starodubtsev and Tizyakova. One of the organizers of the Emergency Committee, Prime Minister, Pavlov, was absent after being hospitalized the day before due to alcohol poisoning. Everyone was nervous, especially Yanayev where everyone could see his shaking hands. During the conference, one person asked our position on the future policy of the country. Should we disown Gorbachev's reforms or not? Or do we make a more original proposal?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001133_DESC;While Gennady Yanayev appointed General Kalinin as the military commander of $CAPITAL$ and declared a curfew in $CAPITAL$ from 11 p.m. to 5 p.m., starting August 20, this was understood as a sign that the attack on the White House. On August 20, around noon, it is estimated that more than 200 000 people gathered around the White House. The rally lasted five hours and many people took the opportunity to make speeches from the balcony. The House of Soviets has become the center of opposition. We must resolve this situation before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001134_DESC;The whole world is wondering what is really happening to Gorbachev. We must decide urgently what to do with him and what to tell the people.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001135_DESC;Seeing that he no longer controls anything, Gorbachev agrees to sign documents in which he withdraws from all positions and transfers power to us. In return, he asks that he can leave the country without a scratch with his wife.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001136_DESC;Gorbachev refused to sign any document and that he only wanted to sign the new treaty. The Committee leaves this exchange with a greater confusion. The members do not really know how to react, even members Dmitry Yazov begins to have a defeatist spirit.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001137_DESC;The Emergency Committee on a State of Emergency did everything it could to try to save the Soviet Union. The only way to know if their coup attempt is successful is if it is validated by the White House (or House of Soviets). All that remains is to wait for the result...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001138_DESC;The White House has just declared the provisional government as unconstitutional and illegal. Therefore, the police is sent to arrest the plotters. Kryuchkov, Yazov and Tizyakov are arrested during the morning, Pavlov, Vasily Starodubtsev, Baklanov, Boldin and Shenin are detained for 48 hours (although Pavlov will be hospitalized because of his illness) and Pugo will die with his wife the next day. The circumstances of Pugo's death are still debated, even if the majority speaks of a double suicide, some say that it was a murder. The immediate consequences are above all a considerable weakening of the CPSU and Gorbachev and a strengthening of the position of Boris Yeltsin and his supporters.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001139_DESC;After several days of pressure from the White House, they finally recognized the provisional government of the Emergency Committee as official. The population seems much more divided on the issue and the situation is far from stable. Meanwhile, Gennady Yanayev was appointed interim President of the USSR while the new government chose a new leader. It was also declared that the State of Emergency is extended for 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001140_DESC;During the following days, different countries around the world began to officially recognize the provisional government of the Emergency Committee. Finally, after only a few days, the White House recognized the Emergency Committee as official and decided to extend the State of Emergency for 5 years. Gennady Yanayev is recognized as the interim President for 6 months, the time for the new government to find a new leader.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001141_DESC;Vladimir Kryuchkov was the head of the KGB but also one of the "leaders" of the Emergency Committee. He was known as a hard-line communist who was always against Gorbachev's reforms. Now that he is in power, Kryuchkov cancels all the reforms undertaken so far and even seems to want to restore the communist regimes in Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001142_DESC;Gennady Yanayev was the President of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and reached the Politburo in 1990 thanks to Gorbachev. He joined the Emergency Committee and became its "official head". He is probably the least politicized member of the group and was chosen because, in addition to his growing doubts about Gorbachev's reforms, he was easily controlled by the real heads of the Emergency Committee, namely Vladimir Kryuchkov and Boris Pugo. However, Gennady Yanayev managed to gain enough trust and autonomy within the group to really come to power and assume the office of President of the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001143_DESC;Boris Pugo was the Minister of Internal Affairs and one of the "leaders" of the Emergency Committee, he was also, which is really rare to say, a pro-Soviet Union Latvian. Pugo was best known for being an ardent supporter of the anti-corruption cause, most notably for politically eliminating Grigory Luchansky, in a case of corruption of public property. Now that Pugo has been appointed as the new leader of the Soviet Union, he will be able to implement reforms following the example of Deng Xiaoping's China.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001144_DESC;Valentin Pavlov was the Prime Minister of the USSR, but he was best known for being the Chairman of the State Price Committee and then Minister of Finance. The reasons for Pavlov's participation in the Emergency Committee can be roughly summarized as follows: While Gorbachev planned to replace him as Prime Minister, Pavlov, who was close to the pro-Soviet Union faction, considered that Gorbachev held too much power and that some of his powers should be transferred to the post of Prime Minister and thus ensure a stable government. Gorbachev blocked the parliamentary vote, which was to his disadvantage, and this convinced Pavlov to join the coup, seeing Gorbachev as a threat to the integrity of the Union and unwilling to go further in the country's economic reforms. Now that Pavlov is the new leader of the Soviet Union, he has already implemented political and economic reforms to the point of transforming the country into a true Social Democracy.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001145_DESC;After the Emergency Committee took power and with the arrival of the new leader of the Soviet Union, a huge purge began to be organized throughout the country. The priority of the purges was to target Nationalists, Liberals and former pro-Gorbachevs, who were perceived as traitors.There are also many victims in the party cadres who participated in corruption cases, regardless of the merit of the position or not.;;;;;;;;;;X

collective_leadership;Collective Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001146_DESC;The concept of Collective Leadership was born after the death of Stalin, for fear of a return to the concentration of power in the hands of one man, and was a proposal of Georgy Malenkov, then Prime Minister of the country, and originally brought together Malenkov, Beria and Molotov. However, this 1st Collective Leadership collapsed when Malenkov and Molotov joined forces with Khrushchev and Zhukov to eliminate Beria, allowing Khrushchev to take power almost single-handedly. Over time, this notion spread throughout the communist countries and was seen as an ideal way of operating and managing. This mode of leadership will continue throughout the history of the Soviet Union until Gorbachev comes to power and Glasnost is introduced, forcing the members of the party leadership to openly disagree with Gorbachev's program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001147_DESC;Nikolai Podgorny participated in the coup against Nikita Khrushchev and was part of a Troika composed of himself, Alexei Kosygin, who became Prime Minister, and Leonid Brezhnev, who became Secretary General. He replaced Anastas Mikoyan in October 1964 as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a position that was mainly honorary but very important as it officially represented the Soviet Union internally and externally. Podgorny was, theoretically, superior to almost everyone and his liberal positions made him a choice opponent for conservatives and even some reformists. However, he retained a fairly high popularity among the population due to his numerous public appearances and even within the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001148_DESC;The Sinyavsky-Daniel trial took place in 1966 in a particular context. After Khrushchev came to power, a relaxation of censorship was felt, intellectuals could talk about more sensitive subjects without allowing themselves to say or write anything about the party. This thaw even gave rise to a joke within the KGB that if the secret service were to arrest every person who made a joke about the General Secretary, there would be no inhabitants left in the USSR. However, after the coup, the conservatives, headed by Brezhnev, began to reapply a more repressive censorship policy using Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code, condemning all anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. Scapegoats were found, Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel for publishing, under a pseudonym, satirical writings on Soviet life in other countries. We can still influence the judges and perhaps prevent the start of a new policy of massive repression against any form of opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001150_DESC;On January 22, 1969, a deserter from the Soviet army, Viktor Ilyin, irritated by his forced conscription and the events of the Prague Spring, decides to take two Makarov pistols and the police uniform of his brother-in-law to $CAPITAL$. At 2:15 p.m., a motorcade entered the Kremlin and Viktor Ilyin took out his pistol and started shooting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001197_DESC;Viktor Ilyin managed to shoot at the car with Leonid Brezhnev. The driver was killed and the General Secretary was seriously wounded and died in the following hours. The shooter was arrested and interrogated by the head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, and explained his motivation. He will be executed in the following months for terrorism. The death of Brezhnev left a political vacuum among the conservatives, Mikhail Suslov became their unofficial leader but did not wish to get involved politically and was not unanimously supported. Alexei Kosygin was now the only important figure in the country and there was nothing will stop him in his desire to reform the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001198_DESC;Viktor Ilyin managed to shoot but got the wrong vehicle and the bullets managed to reach the car where cosmonauts returned from a previous mission are located. The driver will be killed but not the primary target. Arrested and questioned by the head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, he said his motivation was to replace Brezhnev with Mikhail Suslov. It is still unknown today whether he had told the truth at the time, but he will be declared mad and will be interned at the Kazan psychiatric hospital until 1990. Long remained hidden, even among the soviet people, this attack will allow Leonid Brezhnev to strengthen his position within the party and to justify certain policies of repression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001196_DESC;On September 11, 1971, the General Secretary of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers died of a heart attack. Nikita Khrushchev was a person full of contradictions, although he denounced Stalin and his methods during the XXth Congress, the latter did not hesitate to use them against his own people or even to build the Berlin Wall. Although his agricultural program seemed good and ambitious, it turned out to be a damp squib and was mostly mismanaged. He succeeded in giving everyone in the Soviet Union a home, even if it was a low-cost building and mostly a temporary solution. He will mark the whole world for being seen as a special reformist, especially for his words and his uncertain speeches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001151_DESC;Although Kosygin never gained dominance over Brezhnev, the latter was still trying to reform the country's economy, this time by strengthening the powers and functions of the regional planners by creating associations. The newly created associations were to increase cooperation between enterprises, and each association was to be specialized in order to prevent each enterprise from being overwhelmed by excessive production. Although the conservatives are in a strong position, we can either slow down the reform so much that it will never be implemented or we can make Kosygin understand that he should stay in his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001152_DESC;After the end of the Politburo reshuffle process, the Soviet leadership moved toward gerontocracy, a form of government in which the leaders are significantly older than most of the adult population. The majority of these appointees were of peasant or working-class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kossygin and Brezhnev are excellent examples of men appointed as a result of Stalin's Great Purge. Young politicians, such as Fyodor Kulakov and Grigory Romanov, were considered potential successors to Brezhnev, but none of them came close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001153_DESC;After the coup against Khrushchev, the cultural climate became more repressive. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was, under Khrushchev, a fairly popular author even if he was criticized. However, since the arrival of the conservatives, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's works quickly stopped and he began to work in secret and in constant fear of death on several works, one of the best known being The Gulag Archipelago. In 1969, he was expelled from the Writers' Union for his "anti-Soviet" writings. In 1970, he will receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, which will make him even more internationally known and his work on the Gulag will be released in the world (except in the USSR, of course) and will be a huge success. Today, the head of the KGB, makes the proposal to either eliminate him with poison or to expel him from the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001154_DESC;Andrei Sakharov was a great Soviet scientist who contributed a lot in the civil nuclear field (he is notably at the origin of the Tokamak, a controlled nuclear fusion reactor, still used in Russia and even in the world), and he will work especially on the RDS-37 project, the first Soviet H-bomb with stages, and on the Tsar Bomba. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in the USSR and in the world, as well as his moral involvement in his projects, will make him start to be politically active. He will enter in frank opposition with the Soviet government will be done in several stages, initially at the time of the attempt by Khrushchev of the election of Nikolai Nuzhdin, former disciple of Trofim Lyssenko, in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. Even if the nomination of Nikolai Nuzhdin will not be made, Sergey Khrushchev, son of Nikita Khrushchev, will order to the KGB to gather compromising information on Sakharov. Then, in 1967, when the ballistic missile defense became a key issue in the American-Soviet relations. In 1975 a Nobel Peace Prize that will make him even more known in the world. In 1976, Yuri Andropov was ready to call him "public enemy number 1". Attempting to kill him will never pass in the West, it is high time to isolate him from any form of life in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001155_DESC;As early as 1970, Brezhnev had tried to politically eliminate Nikolai Podgorny because he held too strong a position in the state. This attempt to get Brezhnev to vote for more power was countered by Podgorny and Kosygin's supporters and went against the principle of Collective Leadership. But now that Brezhnev's power has grown stronger over the years, it is now possible to eliminate Podgorny. We can, of course, consider a more...traditional elimination, or we can accept Grigory Romanov's proposal to vote him out and change the constitution to make it more advantageous to Brezhnev and the conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001157_DESC;The 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union was unanimously adopted by the Supreme Soviet and replaced the 1936 Constitution. In addition to being more comprehensive, with 28 more articles than the previous constitution, it explicitly defined the division of responsibilities between the central government in $CAPITAL$ and the republican governments. Among its additional articles was an old promise dating back to the very beginning of the October Revolution: Article 72, which theoretically allowed any republic to separate from the Union. The particularity, not much emphasized at the time, was the fact that the Preamble of the Constitution stated that "the objectives of the dictatorship of the proletariat having been achieved, the Soviet State has become the State of the whole people". This referred to Brezhnev's "Slogan", which allowed him to stay in power: "Communism has been achieved", which justified the laissez-faire economic and social situation of the country, today called "Era of Stagnation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001158_DESC;The Economic Reform of 1979 will be the last attempt of Kosygin to reform the Soviet economy, which was aimed at "Improving planning and strengthening the effects of the economic mechanism on increasing the efficiency of production and improving the quality of work". The reform was never implemented and the little that was done only made the situation worse locally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001159_DESC;With the consolidation of Brezhnev's power, Kosygin's influence in the Politburo gradually waned during the 1970s and he was frequently hospitalized. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976 and his health deteriorated over the years. Finally in October 1980, Kosygin was hospitalized one last time. Well aware that his death was near, he quickly wrote a letter of resignation and almost immediately lost all government protection, communication and all the luxury goods he had earned during his political life. He finally died on December 18, 1980 and no Politubo college, former aides or security guards visited him. He represented the reformist line of the party and he put all his talent to try to reform the economy of the Soviet Union but was always prevented by the conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001160_DESC;Although he was closely linked to Stalin, Alexander Shelepin was not affected by the De-Stalinization and even became friends with Nikita Khrushchev. As First Secretary of the Komsomol, the youth organization of the Communist Party, he sent a lot of young communists during the Virgin Lands Campaign, which allowed him to become President of the KGB in 1958. Shelepin will deeply modify the methods of the KGB by replacing many agents by young academics and Komsomol, which will restore the public image of the Secret Service and will change its methods of approaches, less brutal. In 1961, he became First Deputy Prime Minister but put his protege, Vladimir Semichastny, in the position of President of the KGB. Despite all this, he will be one of the main plotters in the coup against Khrushchev in 1964. Now that Alexander Shelepin has become General Secretary of the CPSU, and leading a fairly large faction of the "hard line" party, the latter does not have enough influence in the army and within the party, which scares the middle manager with his ambitions, his vision for the development of the Soviet Union and the communist movement in general, but also by his requirement in the skills of party members. With Semichastny, it will be necessary to decide how to go about it so that he remains in power and clears his rival, Leonid Brejnev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001161_DESC;After a long discussion between the most loyal members of the party, it was decided that the easiest way to stay in power would be to use the army as a means of pressure on the party, failing to have a clearly established majority. It remains to be seen how the KGB can influence the Soviet army. Either we try to put pressure on them by using real or fake evidence on the Generals, but this strategy seems risky, or we try to influence them enough to make them support us or, simply, we organize a secret meeting with the Marshal and the Generals to find a compromise with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001162_DESC;After a long discussion between the most loyal members of the party, it was decided that the easiest way to stay in power would be to have a clearly established majority within the party in order to ensure some form of stability. The question is how the KGB can influence the party. Either we try to pressure them by using real or fake evidence on the most imminent cadres and members, but this strategy seems risky, or we try to influence them enough to support us, or we simply organize a secret meeting with the other Brezhnev rivals to find a compromise with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001163_DESC;Shelepin, with the help of the KGB, managed to keep himself in power by politically eliminating Brezhnev. Now that Alexander Shelepin has become the de facto leader of the Soviet Union, he will finally be able to realize his ambitions for the Soviet Union and for the communist movement in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001164_DESC;Unfortunately, the attempt to keep Shelepin in power could not be realized because of Brezhnev's already too great influence. Brezhnev's conservatives really took the upper hand over Shelepin's faction and the latter was politically eliminated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001165_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in $CAPITAL$, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress since the withdrawal of Khrushchev. This Congress will offer places to personalities in key positions, such as Shelepin, Kosygin and others. But it is important because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters propose to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, Alexander Shelepin, recently seduced by the proposals of the cybernetics, puts forward the idea of automating the economy of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001166_DESC;After a lengthy debate, a vote was taken by show of hands and Shelepin's proposal passed with a majority. With the support of his faction, a huge budget was released, starting with the widespread use of computers. The final goal will be to create a computer network linked throughout the country and calculating in real time the production and all other forms of information. The OGAS Project seems to have started well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001167_DESC;After a long debate, a vote was held by show of hands and Kosygin's proposal passed with a fairly close majority. This reform would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set prices and wages, to hire, to order...). It will be first tested in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant. However, this reform met with resistance from conservatives because it required the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and feared that this would lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001168_DESC;Kosygin's reforms turn out to be a failure. In addition to not solving the problems raised, but this leads to an increase in imports, especially wheat, for the Soviet Union. We can take the advantage in this situation and bring Shelepin's proposals back to the forefront and silence reformist Kosygin and his supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001169_DESC;With the coming to power of Shelepin, a recentralization of power could be observed, whether by the party, the population but even outside. Theoretically, the Soviet Union still claims to be a federation where each republic can vote laws and so on. but in fact, all decisions are taken in $CAPITAL$ with the approval of the Secretary General. Some observers are starting to talk about "Fake Federation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001201_DESC;When Shelepin was Chairman of the KGB under Khrushchev, he proposed the destruction of numerous documents related to the Katyn massacre of Polish officers in order to minimize the chances of the truth being revealed. Finally, even the destruction of the file had already started, it never succeeded. Now that Shelepin is the leader of the USSR, he has the possibility of actually destroying all evidence of this massacre and never being able to really indict the Soviet power in this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001170_DESC;Today, the Secretary General has succeeded in passing an administrative reform in order to make it much more efficient. Indeed, from now on, the members of the bureaucracy will be based on precise selection criteria, and no longer only on party membership or not, and the benefits that will be given to bureaucrats will be framed according to their performance and especially their skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001171_DESC;A new institution has just been born in the Soviet Union, the "Disciplinary Committee of the CPSU". Supervised by the KGB, this committee will be in charge of constantly monitoring the efficiency of the Soviet administration and exposing cases of corruption. Besides improving the quality of the administration, the exposure of corruption cases made the institution more popular with the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001172_DESC;In recent years, a phenomenon has started to appear in the USSR. More and more citizens are just starting to enjoy the benefits of Soviet society without fulfilling their duty like going to work, without being told anything. To avoid a future disaster, Alexandre Shelepin asked the KGB to survey the streets and the countryside and verify that each citizen is doing his job, this can go as far as removing certain advantages. If some Communists criticize this policy, this helps to ensure the efficiency of the workers and to avoid what Shelepin now calls "parasitism".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001173_DESC;Although Leonid Brezhnev no longer had as much influence in the party, he still had a great presence and still had a small faction of followers around him. We can decide to leave him in his position, of course, but we can decide to eliminate him permanently. There are several possibilities: Either we can send him to an insignificant position, as a factory manager in a distant republic, or, simply, banish him from the party. However, the head of the KGB brought clear evidence of corruption, worse, Brezhnev bought a large amount of Western cars on the black market. This is the ideal evidence to get rid of him and to legitimize Alexander Shelepin's fight against corruption and the fight against "parasitism".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001174_DESC;Comrade Alexander Shelepin, General Secretary of the CPSU, has died. Although he represented the hard line of the party, because of his demands or his will to spread communism in the world. Although he was criticized by some members of the party, all those who worked closely or distantly with him became his most loyal supporters. Now that he is dead, his idea of automating the Soviet economy through the OGAS Project is not yet accomplished. Should we continue his work or not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001200_DESC;After the death of Leonid Brezhnev, the conservatives were considerably weakened, although still present. Even if Podgorny occupies an important place, Alexei Kosygin is the one who is the most unanimous within the party. Thus, even if Kosygin is not the General Secretary, he places at its head Dmitry Polyansky, one of his greatest loyalists, and becomes de facto head of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001175_DESC;During a visit to East Germany, Kosygin takes the opportunity to make a surprise announcement that the Soviet Union will begin to open up commercially to other countries and encourages other Eastern European countries to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001177_DESC;Now that Kosygin was in control of the country, he could finally reform the country's economy, this time by strengthening the powers and functions of regional planners through the creation of associations. The newly created associations were to increase cooperation among enterprises, and each association was to be specialized to prevent each enterprise from being overwhelmed by excessive production. The question remains as to what this reform should prioritize. Either we give the people more economic freedom or we take the opportunity to just improve living standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001178_DESC;Since the death of Brezhnev and Kosygin's rise to power, General Secretary Dmitry Polyansky has taken advantage of his position to recruit young communists with reformist ideas into the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet. Of course, this does not please the conservatives and in the place of debate, we see violent arguments between party members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001179_DESC;During Khrushchev Thaw, a limited form of censorship in the cultural sphere was established, which allowed some foreign films, books, art and music to be opened to the Soviet society and some authors, who were previously forbidden, were able to appear without any censorship. After the coup against Khrushchev, a certain form of censorship was revived under the influence of conservatives. However, now that Kosygin is in power and the conservatives are weakened, it is possible to restore this policy without any fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001181_DESC;The importance of the army in the politics of the communist party already played an important role before the 1940s, but its role became indispensable since the WWII and especially since the beginning of the Cold War in which a large part of the country's budget was reserved for the army. Although popular at the end of the WWII, its popularity decreased with time and the budget reserved for the army became a subject of debate within the party. We can decide to keep this form of army under permanent construction by investing a lot of money in it, or we can decide that the army will only play a defensive role for the maintenance of the Soviet Union and take advantage of this to decrease the duration of conscription.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001182_DESC;The leader of the Soviet Union, in a speech on television, announced that the party would work on a major political reform to liberalize the country. No one knows yet what it might be, but it is certain that the population is talking a lot and this reform seems to raise a lot of expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001183_DESC;Shortly after the announcement of a major political reform and the first debates, the conservatives began to denounce a desire to destroy the Soviet Union. Becoming more and more vocal, it became urgent to find a way to silence these dinosaurs that only slowed down the policy of the reformers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001184_DESC;If until now Alexei Kosygin and Nikolai Podgorny were able to agree on the line to follow, with the elimination of the conservatives, their differences have come to light. Podgorny wanted the political reforms to go further and give the Soviet people more freedom, while Kosygin considered that it was necessary to be more cautious and pragmatic and that the party should always keep some control over the situation. Although torn, the party must now decide who to support and what direction to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001185_DESC;The Constitution of the Soviet Union of $YEAR$, with the great support of Kosygin's supporters, has just been adopted by the Supreme Soviet, which officially holds the legislative power and where the next laws will actually be voted. More freedoms have been granted to the Soviet population and, surprisingly, an old promise from the October Revolution has been fulfilled. From now on, the Soviet Union becomes a Confederation in which each republic can become independent, although the process of independence is filled with certain conditions, it could cause problems if we do not keep some control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001187_DESC;Incorporated shortly before World War II and as required by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Baltic States were incorporated into the Soviet Union after a long and violent incorporation process. However, the population of these countries have always perceived the USSR as an invader and since the adoption of the new Constitution, these countries have requested independence from $CAPITAL$. Should we accept this request, find some kind of compromise or simply betray what we have established?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001188_DESC;Agriculture has always been a problem in the USSR, not being able to meet the demands of the population, and even if there are no more famines, problems of shortage still persist. We now have the opportunity to try to introduce the Hungarian model by decentralizing the management of collective farms and state farms, creating agricultural cooperatives based on family contracts and individual exploitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001190_DESC;Kirill Mazurov was an important figure in Soviet Belarus and is still highly respected in his home country. Since he came to power in Belarus in 1956, he remained in Minsk and continued to develop his country both in the mining industry and in agriculture. We can reward Mazurov for his deserved efforts or we can show the world the Belarusian model and where the Soviet Union wants to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001192_DESC;From 1976, with the first heart attack of Alexei Kosygin, this one will go more and more to the hospital, so much so that Kosygin will find a replacement under the name of Kirill Mazurov. This one will take more and more place and is now seen as his successor. And when Alexei Kosygin dies on December 18, 1980, a huge tribute is paid throughout the country and is considered a great reformer and having contributed much to his country. From now on, it is enough to find a successor, even if Kirill Mazurov is in a very good position, Yuri Andropov claims to be the leader of the Soviet Union, wishing to go further in the political and especially economic reforms of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001186_DESC;The Constitution of the Soviet Union of $YEAR$, with a small majority under the influence of Podgorny, is adopted by the new assembly of the USSR, the Supreme Soviet. Great political freedom was granted to the Soviet population, since an old promise dating back to the October Revolution was fulfilled, transforming the USSR into a Confederation, allowing each republic that wished to become independent. Even if it is not registered, Podgorny made the population promise free and fair elections!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001195_DESC;The head of state of the USSR, Nikolai Podgorny, died. He was considered the most liberal of the reformers and wanted to satisfy the population with the increase of consumer goods. His death meant the beginning of free elections in the whole country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001202_DESC;Although Kosygin's Agricultural Reform has brought about an advance in agriculture, problems still persist. The new Secretary General, Kirill Mazurov, has the ambition to build on the work of his predecessor to solve the problem of agriculture in the Soviet Union once and for all. For this, we have two approaches, either we learn from our mistakes and we take advantage of it to revive the Virgin Lands Campaign but on a scientific basis, or we ask our scientists to find a solution in order to quickly compensate our shortcomings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001203_DESC;At a session of the Plenum of the Central Committee, General Secretary Krill Mazurov a Food Program to improve and improve the conditions of Soviet agriculture by improving the planning mechanism. To achieve this goal, the local bureaucracy was reorganized to increase its efficiency, new roads will be built and new equipment will be distributed to peasants. The supervision of this project will be the Secretary of the Central Committee responsible for Agriculture, Mikhail Gorbachev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001204_DESC;A surprising news has just been announced to the people, the launch of a new Virgin Lands Campaign. This time, the government will avoid the mistakes of Khrushchev and will be based on scientific studies, the campaign will be done gradually and according to the number of participants in the project, infrastructure and equipment. The SSR of Kazakhstan welcomes the news with enthusiasm, dreaming of being able to work on this project again and many volunteers are already flocking from all over the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001205_DESC;It was finally decided that it was necessary to compensate for the shortages as a matter of priority, for this purpose a new branch in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union with the best specialists was created in order to find a solution as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001206_DESC;Ivan Michurin was a Soviet arborist and an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. He is the founding father of scientific agricultural breeding and worked on hybridization of plants of similar and different origins. He introduced more than 300 new varieties and received the Order of Lenin's Red Flag of Labor for his achievements. Recently, our scientists have been studying the work of Comrade Michurin and although some aspects of his work need to be revised, the essence of his work is still relevant and our scientists report that the best way is to follow his teachings and to develop genetics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001207_DESC;After years of development, the first Soviet GMOs were created, allowing the creation of many varieties of plants very quickly. Faced with this success, it was decided to generalize this practice throughout the Soviet Union, which will allow an enormous agricultural and scientific advance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001208_DESC;During his rule in Belarus, Mazurov allowed the rehabilitation of many party and state figures, underground fighters from Minsk and guerrilla commanders, which led to a certain political relaxation in Belarus compared to the rest of the Union. Now that he is in power, a "political" amnesty is possible, but it remains to be seen what kind of personality we want to free. Either we release political figures who have been judged too harshly or we release intellectuals and authors for the same reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001209_DESC;Alcohol has always played an important role in the population and different regimes have tried to deal with the problem in different ways. However, since the 70's, the consumption of alcohol has increased, reaching a historical record, it is necessary to act urgently and several solutions are offered to us: Either we ban alcohol, as in the time of the Russian Empire, or we start an anti-alcohol campaign to encourage people to consume less, or, a more original proposal, we increase the price of alcohol. In addition to encouraging people to consume less alcohol, we have an additional source of income.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001210_DESC;Roads in the Soviet Union were not as developed as in the Western Bloc for several reasons: It was better to use public transportation, the government did not necessarily have the money to have roads everywhere, the climate of the country does not help, anyway, for the construction of roads and especially, the USSR had the technology to build tanks but not for "civil" vehicles (Especially since the car procession was considered a bourgeois whim). It is only with the arrival to power of Khrushchev, and with the help of Fiat, that the construction of cars was possible and these last ones answered the soviet criterion, that is to say, not or afraid of maintenance, easy to manufacture or to repair and all-terrain. However, due to the demand of the population to have a vehicle, Mazurov would like to realize one of the wishes of Khrushchev, that everyone has a car. We can, of course, just improve the roads or improve them and then liberalize the sale of vehicles for civilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001211_DESC;Comrade Kirill Mazurov, General Secretary of the CPSU, died leaving behind him a reformed and modernized Soviet Union. Even if some problems remain, most of the work has been done and reformers like Gorbachev wanting to go further are considered too radical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001002_DESC;Although Beria was not the official leader of the Soviet Union, he was part of a Triumvirate, which included Malenkov and Molotov, and he was said to possess a great deal of power, due to his position in the Triumvirate and as Minister of the Interior. While he had become known worldwide as a kind of executioner feared by Stalin himself, the latter undertook very liberal reforms: the transfer of the Gulag system to the Minister of Justice, the political release of more than a million people, the arrest of Stalinist trials such as the White Coat Conspiracy or the Mingrelian case. Worse, Beria promised to unite the German people if the new government was neutral and demilitarized. This surprised the whole world, but Beria was never anything but an opportunist looking for more power and these reforms are once again the proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001003_DESC;On June 17, 1953, riots took place in the German Democratic Republic due to the food crisis, over-industrialization and the desire of the Soviet leadership to make Germany a neutral and democratic state. The situation worsened when the American Sector Radio in West Berlin reported the events in Berlin. The crowd seized several important buildings and it became urgent to settle the situation immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001004_DESC;We have just received a call from East Germany, they are undergoing a large-scale revolt and because of Beria's actions, we must act quickly before it is too late. Some of the hardest members propose that we send our tanks to the region and that we put Wilhelm Pieck in power, others, more moderate, propose that we help the East German government to suppress the movement and that we install a compromise person named Walter Ulbricht, and finally others propose that we install Otto Grotewohl as head of the government and that he concedes to some necessary reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001005_DESC;After the events in East Berlin and the actions he took, Beria found himself even more surrounded by enemies. A conspiracy began to be organized, consisting of Molotov, Khrushchev, Zhukov and part of the army and even Malenkov, who was theoretically his most loyal and powerful ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001006_DESC;On June 26, 1953, Beria was summoned to a meeting of the Presidium and suddenly Khrushchev launched a scathing attack on Beria, accusing him of being a traitor and a spy in the pay of the British secret service. All other members immediately launched their attacks. Completely surprised, Beria asked Malenkov for support. Malenkov lowered his head and pressed a button under his desk and Zhukov and a group of armed officers entered the room and arrested Beria. It seems that Beria was executed on December 23, 1953 and pleaded on his knees before collapsing to the floor and crying. His death now meant a new internal struggle between party members. It remains Nikita Khrushchev, representing the more reformist faction of the party and the Stalinist faction, with the personalities of Malenkov and Molotov.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001007_DESC;As promised by Beria, and with the agreement of the leaders of the West, Germany is now united and demilitarized. In order to avoid an escalation of tension, it was decided that the new government would remain neutral in this conflict. If the whole world welcomes this achievement, it makes the people in the Kremlin angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001008_DESC;The intelligence service under the orders of Beria, the MKVD, has just learned with amazement that the members of the party and the Politburo seem to coordinate with the Red Army to prepare something against the power in place. It is already too late to counter them, but we must prepare for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001009_DESC;In this beautiful morning, it is with amazement that we can see tanks walking around in various places of $CAPITAL$ and soldiers captured MKVD agents. However, the main target of this coup is Lavrentiy Beria but he is still untraceable. Soldiers loyal to Zhukov would later learn from an MKVD agent that Beria had been briefed and prepared forces loyal to him in the south of the country and tried to arrest "Stalinists and brainless monsters". Even if the CPSU and the army regained control of the country, a new Civil War between conservatives and Beria will beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001010_DESC;A new Civil War has just broken out and we, the RRS, are going to play a primordial role in this conflict since we are going to have to choose a side. Either we stay loyal to Beria, or we go back to fight with the USSR, or we take advantage of this chance to fight for our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001011_DESC;The Civil War ended and it was a victory for the Beria camp. Trials began to be held against the plotters and members of the party and the army in general. To celebrate this victory, a big parade will be organized in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001012_DESC;The Civil War has ended and this is a victory for the conservatives. Faced with the betrayal of the MKVD, the service is completely purged and a new one is created, the KGB, which will be much more loyal to the interests of the party. Beria's supporters will be judged and those who managed to escape will be hunted down all over the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001014_DESC;After a Civil War and work, a new constitution was adopted in the Soviet Union. The new constitution is much more liberal and elections are scheduled soon. We can say that there is a before and after Beria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001015_DESC;Today is the trial of Beria, this one is judged, among other things, of treason, sabotage, being a spy for the British services ... In short, the list is long and Beria is judged for the example and to show the way not to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001212_DESC;Faced with the policy of De-Stalinization and the beginning of cultural thawing undertaken by Nikita Khrushchev, a coup attempt is underway. They gathered most of the Stalinists, that is, Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich, and so many others who joined them later who were dissatisfied with the direction taken by Khrushchev. They called a meeting in the Presidium to remove him. Although the majority of members were not present, the plotters represented the majority at that time. However, this coup d'√©tat could fail thanks to the support of the Minister of Defense and Marshal of the Soviet Union, Georgy Zhukov. It was enough to give the order and Zhukov and his armies came to intimidate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001213_DESC;Although the Sovnarkhoz, meaning Economic Councils, is not in itself a new concept and had been applied before the establishment of economic planning by Stalin in 1932. However, Nikita Khrushchev revived this concept with the aim of decentralizing the economy by sector, headed by their respective ministers, with the creation of a network of territorial councils throughout the USSR. However, a short period of decentralization in the early years of the reform aimed at breaking the rigidly centralized sectoral management system that had been in place since the mid-1930s, led to the destruction of a single technical policy and the disintegration of economic ties in industry and agriculture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001214_DESC;On his 60th birthday in 1956, Zhukov received his fourth Hero of the Soviet Union award, making him the first person to receive this honor four times. He became the highest ranking military officer who was also a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. He then became a symbol of national strength. However, this worried the CPSU that he could organize a coup d'√©tat, these fears were further reinforced when Zhukov demanded that the political agencies of the Red Army report to him before the Party. Even if he remains faithful to Khrushchev, the risk is too great to do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001215_DESC;With Khrushchev's rise to power, he began a cultural liberalization, which allowed some foreign films, books, art and music to be available to the population. Some previously banned writers and composers, such as Anna Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko, were brought back into public life, and books by some internationally acclaimed authors were published in millions of copies to satisfy the interest of readers in the USSR. Russian composers, performers and music listeners experienced a new openness in musical expression. Although the Thaw was seen as a period of openness and liberalization, Khrushchev continued to impose restrictions on these newfound freedoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001216_DESC;In 1959, the American National Exhibition was held in $CAPITAL$ and the goal of the USA was to show the productivity and prosperity of the United States so that, in the long term, the Soviet Union would devote its resources to the development of consumer goods, and thus reduce the development of the Heavy and Military Industry. This had more unexpected results such as the spectacular consumption of Pepsi, a debate between Nixon and Khrushchev called afterwards "The Kitchen Debate", but especially the discovery of Corn by Khrushchev. Convinced that corn would solve the agricultural problems in the Soviet Union, he wanted to put it absolutely everywhere. We could try to convince him to calm down about this thing before he is ridiculed... again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001218_DESC;In order to give shelter to everyone, Khrushchev launches the massive construction of buildings, generally limited to 5 floors, at low cost. These buildings were designed to be optimized in all possible aspects. Whether it is the size of the rooms, the size of the rooms... even the stairs were studied so that the grandmother could not make too much effort. Faced with this generalization, the population began to give the name of Khrushchyovka to designate the buildings of 5 floors built at that time. However, this is only a temporary solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001219_DESC;In 1961, Nikita Khrushchev will take a decision that will not please the party at all, that of removing the body of Stalin in the Mausoleum of Lenin.Although this was in the continuity of the De-Stalinization, the party members still respected Stalin and even among the population, this could cause some emotions and misunderstanding. Should we continue the destalinization or be more pragmatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001220_DESC;After Stalin's death, a triumvirate was formed around Malenkov, Molotov and Beria. However, the power was actually held by Beria, through his position in the Triumvirate but also as Minister of the Interior. However, in order to maintain his power or even to take it. Faced with his liberal positions and the problems he generated in East Germany, a conspiracy was organized within the party, composed of Malenkov, Molotov, Khrushchev and Zhukov to get rid of him for good and will die on December 23 begging for his fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001221_DESC;After the fall of Beria, an internal struggle within the party had begun to choose the new leader of the Soviet Union. There were two camps: the Malenkov faction, representing in a more general way, the Stalinist faction and the Khrushchev faction, perceived as more moderate. It is obvious that Khrushchev is especially more appreciated because potentially more easily influenced. We can always try to use our still dominant position to get him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001222_DESC;Now that any form of opposition that is too dangerous has been eliminated. The party is still divided over who to trust as leader of the Soviet Union. There are two contenders: Georgy Malenkov, perceived as a moderate, wishing to reform the country while remaining true to the principles of Lenin and Stalin and seen as Stalin's unofficial successor and Vyacheslav Molotov, a fanatical admirer of Stalin and perceived as a "hardliner" and Stalin's "spiritual" successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001223_DESC;After the Stalinist takeover and the political or physical elimination of our enemies. The Marshal of the Soviet Union, having kept his military and political positions, tried to organize a coup d'√©tat to stop us and set up a less authoritarian regime. We can always turn the tables by using the population and the KGB to spread false information to counter Zhukov.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001224_DESC;After Zhukov's attempted coup, a trial will be held to try him for this inadmissible action. The problem is that we have just learned that he will try to escape into exile. The KGB is sent in urgently so that he can be arrested before that becomes worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001260_DESC;Zhukov is stopped in extremis before he leaves the Soviet territory, forcing him to land in Minsk. Zhukov is thus brought back to $CAPITAL$, watched H24. At the time of the trial, Zhukov did not even attempt to defend himself and the jury returned its verdict. Zhukov was not sentenced to death, but was condemned to stay in his Dacha all his life and to be permanently watched by guards. The sentence was avoided because the former General was extremely popular in the army, among the population and even internationally, perceived as the one who defeated Fascism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001261_DESC;As Zhukov was flying abroad, our agents tried to stop him, but as he did not seem to want to cooperate, our pilots shot at the plane, making it land near the Polish border. The death of the ex-general shocked the whole world. Even if we say that his death was accidental, no one really believes it, theories are even starting to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001262_DESC;Horror! Georgy Zhukov managed to escape and went into exile in the United States and was welcomed by President Eisenhower. In addition to this, Zhukov tells about the conditions of life in the Soviet Union and of course it is not very advantageous for us. Our international reputation is completely stained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001225_DESC;The failed attempt to take power by the army, led by Zhukov, left an atmosphere of general suspicion. To remedy this, it seems that Secretary General is launching a Great Purge within the party and in all institutions. It remains to be seen how extensive this purge will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001226_DESC;Trofim Lyssenko was a Soviet agricultural technician and was at the origin of a pseudo-scientific genetic theory, the "Michurinian genetics", especially promoted during the Stalinist period. Stalin especially supported Lyssenko to be able to eliminate his political opponents much more easily, especially since Lyssenko was a convinced Marxist-Leninist and did not hesitate to be overzealous. Now that Stalin is dead and his faction is still in power, we have to decide what to do with him, who has become much too cumbersome scientifically and even internationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001228_DESC;The place of Stalin's cult in Soviet society after his death was predominant. However, a new moderate leader has come to power and can decide the fate of Stalin and his cult. It is possible to keep the status-quo by maintaining the Cult of Stalin, or to create a commission to evaluate Stalin's actions while valuing him, or to denounce him by restoring the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001229_DESC;With the coming to power of Malenkov, a reorganization of the planned economy of the Soviet Union will begin. Malenkov explained to the Central Committee that the aim of this reform is not to modify in depth the model imposed by Stalin, that is to say centered on the Heavy Industry, but to favor more one sector to answer better the needs of the population. However, a debate is taking place to know if it is necessary to favor more the Light Industry or the Consumer Goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001230_DESC;Agriculture in the Soviet Union has always been a problem and has never really been a problem. However, Georgy Malenkov is the new person who will try to solve this thorny problem. The solution he advocated was, first, to reduce taxes for all peasants, then to increase the amount paid to kolkhozes by the state for grain and incentives for peasants to cultivate their private plots. Many members see this proposal as very costly and inefficient. Other members propose the mechanization of the farms to improve their productivity and others, finally, propose an immediate solution of buying grain abroad to avoid new famines or shortages.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001231_DESC;Malenkov had also talked about the possibility for peasants to have their own plot of land for their own crops. This seems to become a reality as a decree will be issued soon, however, the Central Committee and Malenkov are still debating to put the limits of this proposal. Malenkov and his supporters would like to create targeted regions throughout the Soviet Union of Autonomous Farms whose primary goal is to do agriculture at the level to be able to feed more or less a maximum of people without waste. However, other, more radical members would like to introduce a Family Contract and start a generalized liberalization of agriculture throughout the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001232_DESC;Since the implementation of Malenkov's economic reforms, the standard of living of Soviet citizens has greatly improved, being able to enjoy products that were previously limited or non-existent for the average citizen. However, the country's economy is not doing as well as hoped but it has not deteriorated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001233_DESC;Although bureaucracy can be useful, its slowness and corruption have been proven. Thus, Malenkov wishes to improve this situation by implementing a reform aimed at the administration. However, some members of the party would like to limit this reform to avoid irritating the bureaucracy too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001234_DESC;To the general surprise, Georgy Malenkov announced his resignation as General Secretary and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The reasons he officially gave were that the reforms he had undertaken did not really correspond to the expected results and that he therefore admitted his mistakes. The unofficial reasons, however, are a bit more complicated. Malenkov's reforms did not really succeed in improving the economic situation of the country,  and even put it into debt, and angered a large part of the CPSU. So, before it was too late for him, Malenkov preferred to resign with honors rather than be ejected. Many candidates wanted to become General Secretary but two personalities stood out: Alexander Shelepin, seen as harder than his predecessor and in the continuity of Stalinism, and Leonid Brezhnev, perceived as more moderate and conciliatory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001235_DESC;Vyacheslav Molotov was throughout his life a zealous supporter of Joseph Stalin and was always loyal to him, even when Stalin arrested his wife for "treason". Now that Stalin is dead and Molotov has become the new leader of the Soviet Union, the question of what to do with the legacy is quite obvious to the new leader. However, the question is how to pay tribute to him. Maintaining the cult of Stalin is obvious, but Molotov hesitates between two choices: either building a Mausoleum for Stalin or, more original, creating a position solely for Stalin by naming him "Eternal Leader of the USSR".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001236_DESC;Although Molotov took power, Malenkov still had an important place in the Central Committee and he demanded that a number of economic reforms be implemented. Although Malenkov argued that these reforms would remain faithful to the model set up by Stalin, it was mainly a question of privileging light industry to meet the needs of the Soviet population over heavy industry. Do we listen and apply, at least in part, Malenkov's reforms or do we maintain Stalin's model?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001237_DESC;More and more people in the party are starting to say that the agriculture of our country has shortcomings and does not meet the needs of the population. To avoid shortages, or even new famines, some members propose the purchase of grain from abroad. However, many members propose to mechanize the farms in order to improve their productivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001238_DESC;In the face of this attempt to seize power by the military, it has become obvious that the army must be gagged and remain loyal to the party only. One proposal, which may cause a scandal within the army, is to strengthen the position and powers of our political commissars so that the army will never again try to overtake us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001239_DESC;Although the Soviet Union and China are allies, more and more tensions are beginning to appear. Indeed, even if both countries have the same admiration for Stalin, the two countries do not necessarily have the same points of view on other subjects such as foreign policy, the management of the economy, the direction that the socialist camp should take, etc. The worst happened when a meeting was held in Romania and the Soviet and Chinese delegates started to insult each other and almost fight. This cannot be tolerated and more and more party members demand that China must submit to the Soviet Union for the sake of the socialist camp.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001240_DESC;Mao has been summoned to $CAPITAL$, he is aware that we are going to demand something of him and he also suspects that it will revolve around our tensions. It remains to be seen how we wish to express our problems with China and Mao.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001263_DESC;For some time now, although the USSR and China are allies and our admiration for Stalin remains the same, tensions are beginning to appear, whether from the strategic point of view of the Socialist Camp, foreign policy, management of the economy, etc., and at a meeting in Romania our delegations almost got into a fight. Today, the Soviet Union has summoned us and demanded our submission so that the latest events will never happen again and for the good of the Socialist Camp over that of the imperialists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001241_DESC;In the face of our attempt to bring Mao, and China by extension, to its senses. We have just learned that Mao has broken our Friendship Pact and that our alliance is worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001257_DESC;Cybernetics in the Soviet Union is a science that conscripted to control the transmission of information in various systems, whether machines, living organisms or society began in the 1940s. Under Stalin's rule, Cybernetics was considered a reactionary American pseudoscience to be denounced and mocked. However, despite this attitude towards this science, more and more party members are showing interest in this discipline, especially in the automation of the economy. Should we reintroduce Cybernetics and study this automation or maintain Stalin's decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001258_DESC;Today Comrade Vyacheslav Molotov, General Secretary of the CPSU, died. For the Western world, he is a hard dictator, intellectually blocked and anchored in a certain worldview. However, even if his dream of creating a kind of supranational entity to encompass all the socialist states did not come true, he left behind a planned and automated economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001259_DESC;Today Comrade Vyacheslav Molotov, General Secretary of the CPSU, died. For the Western world, he is a hard dictator, intellectually blocked and anchored in a certain worldview. However, even if his dream of creating some kind of supranational entity to encompass all the socialist states did not come true, he left the country in such a state that economic and political reforms will be necessary to try to save the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001244_DESC;On his 60th birthday in 1956, Zhukov received his fourth Hero of the Soviet Union award, making him the first person to receive this honor four times before Brezhnev awarded it to himself. He is thus Marchal of the Soviet Union and an important member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In addition, he began to demand that the political agencies of the Soviet Army report to him before the Party. More and more Party members accused him of being a reformist and, even worse, a Bonapartist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001245_DESC;Faced with the reformist vision of the Marshal of the Soviet Union, Georgy Zhukov, and due to the fact that he is a very popular military man, a coup attempt is underway. They gathered most of the Stalinists, i.e. Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich, and so many others who would join them later, fearing Zhukov's takeover. They called a meeting in the Presidium to remove him from office. Although the majority of members were not present, the plotters represented the majority at that time. However, this coup was able to fail thanks to the support of the First Secretary of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev. It was enough to give the order and Khrushchev and his thousands of party members in $CAPITAL$ and throughout the country will march to help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001343_DESC;In a few hours, the Marshal of the Soviet Union, Georgy Zhukov, has the honor of delivering the opening speech of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, which will decide for the next few years the economic and political direction of the country. Exceptionally, the party has offered a car to the Marshal to get to the meeting place. However, during the journey, a dull but audible noise began to be heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001344_DESC;In the middle of the journey, in the middle of $CAPITAL$, an explosion can be heard and a certain panic in the allentour.A few hours later, the tragic news is reported to the population, the Marchal of the Soviet Union, the henchman of Fascism, has been killed in an attack described by the KGB, as terrorist, suspecting nationalist dissidents. Three days of mourning are decreed in the whole country and a new Marshal is appointed by the party and Nikita Khrushchev makes a tearful speech, knowing that he becomes the uncontested leader of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001345_DESC;After arriving at the CPSU Congress in $CAPITAL$, the car explodes, killing the driver and some soldiers. The shock was total, both for the population and for the Marshal, who managed to escape death in a few minutes. Although an investigation was opened, the KGB concluded that it was a nationalist attack, the army suspecting that the party wanted to kill Zhukov because he was too troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001247_DESC;Now that Zhukov's hands are more or less free, he can begin to undertake military reforms so that the country can defend itself against all forms of aggressors and make the army modern and efficient, if possible without the CPSU having a word to say about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001248_DESC;The Novorossiysk, originally named Giulio Cesare, was an Italian battleship that was transferred to the Soviet Union in 1949. However, the ship was sunk by an old German mine in 1955, resulting in 608 deaths, and Marshal Zhukov took the opportunity to remove Nikolai Kuznetsov from his position as Admiral of the Soviet Union Fleet. One could continue to use this excuse to give less importance to the navy and thus privilege the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001249_DESC;Today, Zhukov and the Central Committee met to implement the military reforms desired by the Marshal of the Soviet Union. The first question of the day, and it is a rather sensitive one, was the place of political commissars in the army. Zhukov never had them, considering that politics should not intervene in military strategies, and would like to get rid of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001250_DESC;The next topic is to improve the quality of the Soviet army, several proposals are on the table. The first one is to reduce the number of soldiers, justified by the fact that these soldiers are not needed anymore since the end of the Second World War and that would allow to win money, the second one is to reduce the duration of the military service, which would allow to greatly improve the quality of the army, and finally, the one proposed by Zhukov, to make a combination of the two proposals. Or, of course, we can change nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001251_DESC;And finally, the last subject, an original proposal of Zhukov, that of transferring the authority of the Militsiya, a kind of police force under the USSR, under his authority so that the local security of the country is in the hands of people who already deal with national security. Of course, this displeases the party members who consider that the army would have too much power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001346_DESC;Faced with the incredible popularity of Marshal Georgy Zhukov, there was a revival of Russian nationalism in the entire Russian-speaking population. Nationalism of any kind has always been fought and suppressed by the party. Although nationalism has always existed in the Soviet Union, this rise in power is impossible to ignore and something must be done. However, some unscrupulous members propose that an arrangement be made with the nationalist movement so that it cannot harm the party or even fight other nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001252_DESC;It is with great surprise that the Marshal of the Soviet Union learns that his ally, Nikita Khrushchev, is organizing a meeting with party members accusing Zhukov of being a dangerous general with too much ambition. However, the Marshal already had a lot of power and was well respected in the army and even among the population. Thus, Zhukov sent his army to $CAPITAL$ to make a show of force and Khrushchev was arrested in the middle of a speech. It remains to be seen whether one wishes to eliminate him by removing him from power or if one proceeds to a more spectacular elimination.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001253_DESC;During a diplomatic visit to the United States, the Marshal of the Soviet Union, Georgy Zhukov, met the American President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. These two personalities met for the first time at the Potsdam Conference and quickly became friends, and the first half of this meeting gave rise to discussions about their memories in the post-war period. After a while, the President managed to talk to Zhukov about the Soviet economic system and compared it to the American one. The Marshal seems to have been very interested in the effects of liberalism. It remains to be seen whether the American President was convincing enough to make the Marshal change, at least partially, his economic system.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001254_DESC;Although the Soviet Union has always had problems with its agriculture, it would seem that a solution must be found to avoid a new general shortage in the country. Some propose buying grain from abroad as an immediate solution, others propose increasing the productivity of the farms by mechanizing them, and finally, a third camp, much more radical, proposes to liberalize the farms with the creation of agricultural cooperatives in order to let the peasants manage their fields and production themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001255_DESC;The increasing accumulation of power in the hands of the military forced the CPSU to give the coveted title of General Secretary of the Party to the Marshal of the Soviet Union, Georgy Zhukov. Thus, it became increasingly common to name the leader Zhukov as "Secretary-Marshal". This is definitive, the party was subjugated and the military is in charge of all political and economic aspects of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001256_DESC;In December 1967, Georgy Zhukov suffered a severe stroke and was hospitalized almost immediately. However, despite the care provided, the stroke of the Secretary Marshal left him paralyzed on the left side, his speech became difficult and he could walk only with assistance, so it becomes impossible for him to lead this country properly. So, in a pre-recorded TV and radio address, the Secretary-Marshal announced his resignation and left the country in the hands of Dmitry Ustinov, a military man who had proven himself under his government and appealed to a large portion of the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001289_DESC;A new meeting of the Central Committee will be held to determine the amount of the budget to be allocated to the different departments. However, the arrival in power of Dimitri Ustinov could change the situation for the military. Indeed, in addition to being a Marshal, Ustinov is a fervent supporter of the international struggle and has always asked for more money for the military so that they can defend the interests of the Soviet Union and even Communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001290_DESC;During the period of Zhukov, the latter had implemented a liberalization of the economy, allowing the country to receive money easily and even the population to have more economic freedom. However, Ustinov and a large part of the CPSU wanted to return to the old model of planned economy, which would not please the population already used to this system.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001291_DESC;With the increase of the budget obtained thanks to Ustinov, it is now possible to transfer this extra money to one of the branches of the army. We can either give more money to the army to equip it with the latest modern equipment to improve its quality, or we can give this money to the Navy to speed up recruitment and build up a huge fleet of ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001293_DESC;The Space Race, started in 1957, was, in fact, a lost cause for the Soviet Union, despite great advances and achievements. Now, all this money injected to serve to help in our development and in the development of other socialist countries. Maybe we could stop this adventure and do something else with this money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001294_DESC;Today, Dmitri Ustinov, Marshal of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU, died. Ustinov did little to try to improve the country's increasingly critical economic situation by favoring the military. His successor in this position, Sergei Sokolov, is considered his military successor but seems to have different ideas about politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001295_DESC;Since the military took power, the question of whether to pursue the cause of Communism has arisen among some military personnel, wanting to assume the true nature of the state of the Soviet Union. However, this is a big risk and the party will not be pleased. Perhaps we should try to save the Soviet Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001296_DESC;The Marshal of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU, Sergei Sokolov, has convened the Politburo to find a solution to try to make reforms to try to save the Soviet Union from falling. The first topic discussed was whether Sokolov wanted to give more power to the Supreme Soviet to transform it into a real legislative power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001297_DESC;The next topic is the duration of the Conscription. It is impossible to consider a reduction of the conscription, as this would be contrary to the current military doctrine. However, we can go further and make military service compulsory for everyone, both men and women, and that it is a matter of survival of the Motherland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001298_DESC;A new reform is the question of the structure of the state, that is, whether Sokolov wants more control over the party and the state by effecting a recentralization, to change nothing or to grant more freedom to the different republics by transforming the USSR into a confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001299_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union played a secondary role due to the fact that they were under the control of the state, however, since the military took power, Sokolov would like to abolish them altogether, considering that the state is already a good enough protector against the citizens. The conservative faction of the party would, of course, like to maintain the system as it is, while others, more reformist, would like to grant more trade union freedom by allowing opposition trade unions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001300_DESC;Since the military took power with Georgy Zhikov, the latter had put in place, under the influence of his friend and the American president, Dwight Eisenhower, a partially liberal economic reform, allowing the population to have their own business and the government to have easy money via taxes. However, when Dmitri Ustinov came to power, faced with growing wealth inequality among the population and increasingly visible anger in the party, the planned economy system had returned. Now, a part of the party and the army want to return to the Zhokov model. What should we decide?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001301_DESC;We have been experiencing economic stagnation for the past few years and we need to address this problem. Part of the party and the army advises that we liberalize our economy in order to revitalize our economy while finding money easily. However, the other part of the party and the army are controlling, claiming that this problem of stagnation is in no way related to our economic system. We will have to decide what we want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001302_DESC;In recent years, especially since Sokolov came to power, the Soviet Union has become so militarized that its economy has begun to be oriented exclusively to the service of the military, and political reforms have taken place, but this has actually hardened the regime, giving it even less power than before. The world is concerned about the turn of events in the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001303_DESC;No reforms, economic or political, have taken place in the Soviet Union. Or at least, these reforms are only of facade but the problems which the USSR meets are always present. Will this be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001304_DESC;Moderate reforms were carried out in the Soviet Union in order to modernize the country, both politically and economically, but also to balance the power between the party and the military, which had become unavoidable. Maybe this will be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001305_DESC;Faced with the big change brought about by the Marshal, Seigei Sokolov, a new treaty was signed by all the republics of the country and was signed at a Special Congress. From now on, the country was called "Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001306_DESC;Today, the Marshal of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU, Sergei Sokolov, died. Leaving behind him a militarized Soviet Union, defending its interests and feared by the Western powers... more than in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001307_DESC;Today, the Marshal of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU, Sergei Sokolov, died. Despite a long reign, no changes were made. This means that major reforms will have to be carried out very quickly if nothing is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001308_DESC;Today, the Marshal of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU, Sergei Sokolov, died. Some reforms were made in order to maintain stability in the Soviet Union. It remains to be seen if this will be enough in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001309_DESC;Today, the Marshal and leader of the Great Russia, Sergei Sokolov, died. By abandoning the cause of Communism, Sokolov was able to do what he wanted without too much ideological questioning. But this earned him many enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001404_DESC;Comrade Viktor Grishin, leader of the Soviet Union, has dead. A lifelong Brezhnevist, Grishin implemented a series of reforms to maintain Brezhnev's political and economic model by increasing the population's standard of living and recentralizing power, which helped stabilize the Soviet Union but also led to an increase in corruption in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001405_DESC;While the Conservatives have been in power for a long time. Today, a new General Secretary has been elected in the Soviet Union. He emphasizes the need for rapid political, economic and social reforms if the CPSU is to continue to exist. Nobody knows yet if these reforms will be beneficial or not for the country, only the future can tell us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001265_DESC;Recently, large oil fields have been discovered in South Yemen. Even though we have large oil reserves, some members warn that it would be prudent to do something in case of a crisis or shortage. The worst thing is that according to the latest information from the KGB, the country's leader, Abdul Fattah Ismail, intends to announce his resignation for medical reasons and Ali Nasir Muhammad seems to be in a position to become his successor and project a unification between the two Yemens. It would be interesting to remove this troublesome person and replace him with a person closer to our interests by supporting separatism between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001266_DESC;Since the establishment of a pro-$CAPITAL$ and separatist government and It took a few years for Ismail's successor to stabilize. Now it may be possible for the Soviet Union to access these oil fields while investing in the economic development of South Yemen. We can send this request to the South Yemeni government in exchange for a portion of their oil to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001267_DESC;With $CAPITAL$'s help, the reformist Ali Nasir Muhammad was eliminated, allowing the General Secretary to suppress the other reformists in the party and prevent the Reunification Project by affirming our cultural identity. Now the Soviet Union has come to us with an investment proposal. In exchange for an important reserve from the sale of oil, they invest in order to develop us economically. The offer is too tempting to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001268_DESC;It was with great surprise that South Yemen refused our investment offer, stating that it refuses to submit in this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001269_DESC;Since our reconciliation between the Soviet Union and China, our two countries exchange a lot despite some diplomatic and political difficulties, which tend to disappear with time. Today, a party member made the suggestion to build a pipeline between our two countries. There are two main reasons for this: first, to symbolize our lifelong friendship with the world, and second, to boost the economy of our two countries. However, the party remains divided when it comes to finances. Some members want the pipeline to be built entirely by us, others would like the project to be built by our two countries in order to divide the burdens in two and symbolically show the cooperation between us, and finally, other minority members say that this project is useless and would be more of a money pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001310_DESC;The year 2017 is a very special year for the Soviet Union, as it is the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution. Throughout the country, throughout the year, broadcasts, demonstrations and other activities will be held to celebrate the Bosheviks taking power over a liberal republic that had already betrayed its people with unpopular reforms and programs such as the continuation of World War I. It remains to be seen what our government and party will focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001311_DESC;The year 2022 is a very special year for the Soviet Union and for the world of proletariat, it is the birth of our country, after 5 years of very brutal civil war. For the occasion, all communist parties from all over the world, whatever their convictions, are invited to a festival to pay tribute to our country and to the workers' cause. The only thing left is the slogan that will have to be displayed everywhere, it could even have consequences at the international level. Which one should we choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001369_DESC;The year 2041 is a very special year for our country, since it is the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, in which Hitler's fascist Germany will launch a cowardly attack against us in order to, among other things, eliminate the Slavic people, destroy the USSR, the symbol of communism, and reappropriate our land and our natural resources such as oil. Naturally, we will pay tribute to our dead, but we must decide what we want to put forward. We can either emphasize the sacrifice of our people, or show the people the horrors of fascism, or emphasize Stalin's inflexibility in the face of his challenges.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001270_DESC;In recent years, increasingly violent and uncontrollable ethnic clashes have taken place in the regions of Central Asia and are beginning to be observed even abroad. However, today, party members from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have offered to hold a vote for the population to determine their future. Of course, $CAPITAL$ is against the proposal for fear of provoking an increase in separatist movements, but some want to take the risk in order to try to appease the population if the referendum is negative.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001271_DESC;It is without great surprise that the population voted yes for the independence of their country. Thus, the governments of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan get their independence and surprise the world that such a thing could take place in the Soviet Union and this could have consequences in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001272_DESC;Contrary to the prognosis, the population voted against the independence of their country. Even though rumors of rigging are circulating throughout the country, especially in the region of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, in the absence of tangible evidence, these rumors are beginning to disappear and a certain calm is returning to the region, although tensions still exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001273_DESC;We have gained our independence from the Soviet Union and our people are in the midst of yes. The influence of the USSR in the region is still important and we will have to choose the government we want to establish. We can, of course, maintain the communist regime in order not to antagonize the USSR, or we can set up a social democracy which would maintain a certain number of achievements of our former republics, which should please the Soviet Union and a part of the population, except for the communists and the nationalists, or we can set up a nationalist dictatorship in order to definitively detach ourselves from the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001321_DESC;A few years ago, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan gained their independence from the Soviet Union. Some of our members proposed to use these countries to get brother-nations and extend the influence of our ideology. However, the Soviet Union is still keeping an eye on the region and considers these countries as a no-go area for everyone, the temptation to strike a powerful blow against the communists is strong but it could have great consequences for us later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001274_DESC;Today, a traditionalist coup d'etat has taken place in the country. The new government says it is inspired by what is happening in Afghanistan as a model. The news is spreading like wildfire all over the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001275_DESC;Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have just come under the control of the Mujahideen after we granted them their independence. It is impossible for us not to react, we cannot afford to have enemies on our doorstep, especially so hostile. Moreover, we have just learned from the KGB that these people have been financed and armed by Afghanistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001276_DESC;A terrorist attack took place in the United States of America against the Two Towers. The attack was claimed by Al Qaeda and the world opinion is shocked by such an action and the Americans are asking for justice. We have discovered that the terrorist organization is based in Afghanistan and, strange as it may seem, this means that we have a common enemy and we can make the proposal to join forces for world peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001322_DESC;Not too surprisingly, the Soviet Union came to support the September 11 attack. However, they came with documents to prove that those behind this infamous crime are based in Afghanistan and they propose, in the face of a common enemy and for the sake of world peace, to join forces and invade the country. The offer is too tempting to refuse even if some want to refuse for fear of the consequences in the long run and some for anti-communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001323_DESC;Accepting our proposal, an action plan was developed together. The Soviet Union will control the northern part of Afghanistan while Pakistan, with the help of the USA, will control the southern part of the country. It is also planned that the capital, once the war is over, will be under the control of the UN in order to avoid any problem between our two countries. In the meantime, for us, it is also a question of taking revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001324_DESC;We accepted the Soviet proposal and a plan of action was worked out together. The Soviet Union will control the northern part of Afghanistan while Pakistan, with the help of the USA, will control the southern part of the country. It is also planned that the capital, once the war is over, will be under the control of the UN in order to avoid any problem between our two countries. On our side, the news was taken with great enthusiasm despite marginal opposition from the left-wing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001325_DESC;Now that the war against Afghanistan is over, it is high time that the Americans take control of its territories as agreed with the Soviet Union in the name of World Peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001326_DESC;Now that the war against Afghanistan is over, as it was planned with the Americans, to give the control of the capital of the country, Kabul, to the UN in order to avoid any kind of tension between our two countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001327_DESC;With the end of the Afghan War, it is a question of how to know what we want to do. Indeed, although we had come up with a plan of action with the Soviet Union to combat a common threat, we had not really decided what future we wanted for Afghanistan, even if the ideal would be to re-form a united Afghanistan. However, more and more members were suspicious of the USSR and wanted to securitize the region by creating a pro-American state. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001329_DESC;It would seem, according to KGB information, that the United States is willing to try to cooperate with us. However, some party members are still suspicious and want to create a pro-Soviet state in order not to lose influence in the region. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001330_DESC;It would seem, according to KGB information, that the United States are much too suspicious of us and are already looking for a person to manage the future state and defend their interests. If some members were skeptical about collaborating with the Americans, but now there is no doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001332_DESC;After long diplomacy between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was possible to create a united and neutral Afghanistan in order to maintain the balance in the region but also to avoid tensions between the two superpowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001333_DESC;Despite numerous attempts to reach an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was impossible to find common ground. As a result, the USA will give independence to what is already called Southern Afghanistan. It remains to be seen whether we want to put in place a nationalist, a more charismatic leader or a democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001336_DESC;Despite numerous attempts to reach an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was impossible to find common ground. Therefore, the USSR will give independence to what is already called Northern Afghanistan. It remains to be seen whether we want to put in place a Khalq leader who is pro-Soviet, or a Parcham leader who is reformist but ensures that they remain loyal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001342_DESC;Following the failure of the two superpowers to agree on the creation of a united Afghanistan, the UN will now have to return the territories it holds in the region. However, since it is the capital of one of the two countries, it will have to decide to whom to give the city of Kabul.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001277_DESC;Holodomor, a Ukrainian term literally meaning "famine" but which can be translated as "extermination by hunger", refers to the period of great famine that affected a large part of the population living from agriculture in a large part of the Soviet Union between 1931 and 1933. This famine started from Ukraine to Western Siberia, passing through the north of Kazakhstan to arrive in the center of Russia. Very quickly, the term Holodomor designates exclusively, without ignoring the other regions affected, the famine of Ukraine between 1932 and 1933. Although still taboo in the Soviet Union, more and more people, especially in Ukraine, ask for an opening of the archives in order to confirm what is reported in the samizdats (clandestine and, generally, dissident publications).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001278_DESC;For several years, more and more members of the Party and the Politburo have been calling for the return of Crimea to the RSFSR, which is increasingly provoking not only the Ukrainian population, which considers this region theirs, but also the Ukrainian SSR, which is less and less appreciative of the fact that the RSFSR is increasingly considering itself a kind of privileged republic. We will have to solve this problem quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001279_DESC;After consultation with the population of Crimea, the results show that the Crimeans are in favor of a return to the RSFSR. The Ukrainians are already crying conspiracy even though in reality, due to the policy of Russification, Crimea is predominantly Russian, so the vote was largely in favor of the RSFSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001280_DESC;After consultation with the population of Crimea, the results show that the Crimeans are in favor of remaining in Ukraine. The Russian population does not understand such a result since the majority of the population in Crimea are Russians thanks to, or because of, the Russification policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001283_DESC;After consultation with the population of Crimea, the results show that the Crimeans are in favor of the creation to Crimea into a new SSR. This choice, on the part of the population, does not satisfy anyone, both Russians and Ukrainians. The situation may have even worsened in the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001284_DESC;Recently, we are witnessing a revival of Ukrainian nationalism. Indeed, more and more are not afraid to fly the Ukrainian nationalist flag and the claims of the movement are quite diverse, some ask for greater autonomy of the SSR while others demand outright independence. There are also shared claims within the movement such as the holodomor or the deportations of part of the population during the civil war. Even if the movement remains controllable, it is likely to explode at some point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001285_DESC;For the past few days, the world can see that the Ukrainian population is demonstrating in the capital, Kiev, and even throughout Ukraine. The nationalist movement has become more radical and they are now demanding independence from $CAPITAL$ and the Soviet Union. More and more people are joining these demonstrations and pressuring the local government to be on their side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001286_DESC;Faced with popular pressure and the unpopularity of the $CAPITAL$ leadership, Ukraine has just declared its independence and that it will fight if necessary. We will have to restore the situation before it degenerates in the other Republics of the Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001287_DESC;Despite the popular pressure, the leadership of Ukraine has just called us that the SSR will remain loyal to the Union, this may not please the population...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001288_DESC;Faced with the silence of the authorities and the beginning of repression by the Soviet police, it became obvious to the population that the Ukrainian government remained loyal to $CAPITAL$. Therefore, a large part of the population decided to arm themselves and fight for their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001312_DESC;Although the different nationalities in the Soviet Union have always been a problem, Chechnya is the region that has always been difficult to manage, even during the Russian Empire. The origin of its conflicts can be traced back to 1785, when Sheikh Mansur united the peoples of the Caucasus region to resist the Russian Empire. However, for some time now, an independence movement has been formed in Chechnya, putting forward their nationality and religion. Worse, even the local government is becoming more and more assertive with a very popular local leader with nationalist and religious ideas. We are going to have to do something very quickly before it is really too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001315_DESC;Faced with the rise of nationalism and fundamentalism in Chechnya, the $MONARCHTITLE$ has declared martial law in the region under the pretext of terrorism and dangerous separatist movement. The army has already been sent, but it is already meeting a great resistance, it may become a long and costly or even disastrous conflict if we don't do the necessary. We will have to decide what to do to weaken the Chechen resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001316_DESC;This year's military report shows that last year's investment has allowed the army to better control the security area. Again this year, we will have to decide what we want to do against the Chechen resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001317_DESC;The military report of this year shows that the investment of the year was not enough, not only the quality of our army has deteriorated, but it is even recorded that we are losing some ground in the region. This year again we will have to decide what we want to do against the Chechen resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001318_DESC;The military report of this year shows that the investment of the year was a disaster, clearly, just sending equipment was not a very good idea since the can of arms we send for our army are taken over by the resistance. Again this year we will have to decide what we want to do against the Chechen resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001319_DESC;After many years of fighting in Chechnya, the Soviet government announced today the end of martial law in the region. The government representative explained that the separatist and fundamentalist threat has been eradicated as a whole. Although the army will remain for some time to ensure the return to civilian life, the international community, especially in the West, has condemned our radical and violent actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001320_DESC;Despite our attempts to pacify the region, the Chechen resistance managed to defeat our army and declared their independence. This is a bitter failure and a humiliation for our countries, we will have to take over the region in a more traditional way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001347_DESC;With our victory against Gorbachev's government, the situation in the country is far from being stabilized. With the arrival of Vladimir Kryuchkov to power, most of the reforms put in place by Gorbachev have been withdrawn, but some party members would like this to be accompanied by a firm condemnation of the former General Secretary of the CPSU, considering him a traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001348_DESC;With our victory against Gorbachev's government, the situation in the country is far from being stabilized. With the arrival of Gennady Yanayev, the party is now in the hands of moderates and more pragmatic reformists. However, the party is divided as to what to do with the reforms of the former General Secretary. Some members, the hardest ones, want to condemn Gorbachev and consider him a traitor, others would like to eliminate some aspects of the reforms that posed more problems than others. And finally, others would like to eliminate either Perestroika, arguing that the liberalization of the Soviet economy was problematic, while others condemn Glasnost, arguing that the liberation of speech has allowed some anti-Soviet discourse to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001350_DESC;With the victory of the August Coup, the popularity of the Soviet government in the other republics has dropped significantly and should not delay in making declarations of independence. This is already the case with Georgia, which already enjoys limited international recognition. However, other republics in the Caucasus are becoming increasingly separatist and may soon declare their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001351_DESC;With the victory of the August Coup, the popularity of the Soviet government in the other republics has dropped significantly and should not delay in making declarations of independence. This is what we have just learned from Turkmenistan, which has just declared their independence. Even if the loss of this republic is not really serious, some party members are afraid that it will cause a kind of chain reaction in the neighboring republics to do the same thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001352_DESC;With the victory of the August Coup, the popularity of the Soviet government in the other republics has dropped significantly and should not delay in making declarations of independence. In Ukraine, after the coup, more and more people are taking to the streets to demand the independence of Ukraine. However, the demonstrations are becoming more and more violent and the demonstrators are starting to arm themselves to get their independence. Ukraine is, no more and no less, than the granary of the Soviet Union, this would represent a great loss for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001353_DESC;With the victory of the August Coup, the popularity of the Soviet government in the other republics has dropped significantly and should not delay in making declarations of independence. In Belarus, after the coup, more and more people are taking to the streets to demand the independence of Belarus. However, the demonstrations are becoming more and more violent and the demonstrators are starting to arm themselves to get their independence. Belarus has a large population within this republic, which would represent a symbolic and cultural loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001354_DESC;With the victory of the August Coup, the popularity of the Soviet government in the other republics has dropped significantly and should not delay in making declarations of independence. In the other Asian republics, after the coup, more and more people are taking to the streets to demand their independence. However, the demonstrations are becoming more and more violent and the demonstrators are starting to arm themselves to get their independence. These republics would be a great economic loss for the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001355_DESC;Although the Conservatives are back in power, the question of the economic model is still relevant. It seems obvious that the government will return to the Planned Economy, however, some party members have other proposals. The first one is to tolerate small businesses, more for pragamatism to get money easily, the second one is to restore the Planned Economy but focusing on military needs, so that we can defend our country from imperialist forces and internal enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001356_DESC;The question of the economic model has still not really been determined by the new government. It was at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers, assisted by President Yanayev, that they met to answer it definitively. The first solution that was proposed by some of the reformists was to reactivate the Liberman Reforms while learning from the lessons learned during its experimentation under Kosygyn. Others propose to be inspired by the economic model of Tito, since it had allowed the country to recover after the World War II. Then, President Yanayev made an original proposal, it would be to return to a planned economy except that the workers would organize themselves freely to manage the enterprises, what he called "Planned Economy with Elements of Self-Management". The idea appeals to some members of the Cabinet and could work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Others propose to be inspired by the economic model of Tito, since it had allowed the country to recover after the World War II. Then, the President made a proposal. In order to bring in foreign investors and bring us closer to China, while keeping some control over the economy, he proposed the idea of introducing the German economic model of "Social Market Economy". The idea appeals to some members of the Cabinet and could work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001358_DESC;One of the reasons for the August Coup was the withdrawal of the Baltic States in the draft of a new treaty proposed by Gorbachev. Now that our situation has been more or less stabilized, some party members would like to take back their lost territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001359_DESC;In these troubled times, it is true that there are always people who stand out more than others by their actions. Today, one of these people is called Vladimir Putin. A few years ago, he was just a KGB agent, but he managed to distinguish himself thanks to his radical and effective proposals to fight against separatist movements and the rise of the mafia throughout the Soviet Union. Thus, as a reward for his actions, Vladimir was appointed President of the KGB.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001360_DESC;Following our withdrawal of a number of reforms and the public condemnation of Gorbachev, a part of the young Muscovites, and now a part of Russia, came to gather on Red Square to make their demands for a freer society and the end of the condemnation of the former General Secretary, seeing him as a kind of martyr of communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001361_DESC;Although we have found some form of stability in the country, Russian nationalism has still not been resolved. To this, some members of the party have proposed a new political theory, the Vozhd: it would be a kind of formal alliance between the Communist Party and the Russian nationalists by putting forward the Russian culture and on the withdrawal on itself, which would allow to justify harder policies towards the dissidents, on the foreign world but also to justify the position of the party in our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001362_DESC;Today, the $MONARCHTITLE$ of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Kryuchkov, is dead. After the victory of the August Coup and the political stabilization of the country, the regime started to harden and the ideology of the party turned into a kind of Russian nationalist socialism with a nuance of authoritarianism and the welfare of the population did not increase as much as one would like. Western countries compare the current regime to that of the Tsars at the time of Ivan IV, but this is probably an exaggeration.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001363_DESC;Today, the $MONARCHTITLE$ of the Soviet Union, Gennady Yanayev, is dead. After the victory of the August Coup and the political stabilization of the country, Gorbachev's reforms were limited and another model of reform was proposed, much more moderate without coming close to the Chinese model. Thus, the world considers that there are now two models for communist reformers: the Chinese model and the Soviet model. However, the Soviet model has some problems that cannot be ignored, but the leadership remains confident that it will resolve its dysfunctions in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001364_DESC;Today, the $MONARCHTITLE$ of the Soviet Union, Boris Pugo, is dead. After the victory of the August coup and the political stabilization of the country, the first years were accompanied by a great purge, both within the party and in the government, regardless of nationality, allowing to greatly limit corruption, and then accompanied by a number of reforms in order to get closer to the Chinese model of reforms. Thus, the multiparty system was maintained but strictly controlled and the country's economy began to open up to the outside world while maintaining great control over business activity. If all goes well, the Soviet Union may even end up being a good competitor against China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001365_DESC;Today, the $MONARCHTITLE$ of the USS, Valentin Pavlov, is dead. After the victory of the August coup and the political stabilization of the country, the $MONARCHTITLE$ continued Gorbachev's reforms but limited them, both in time and in a less radical way. Thus, the Soviet Union, under its new name of "Union of Sovereign States", was able to become a Social Democracy without causing its downfall, and to make itself look good internationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001366_DESC;On August 30, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar ASSR adopted the Declaration on State Sovereignty. Following this, a referendum should be held soon, but many party members would like to break the promise of the referendum on the grounds that Tartaristan is part of the RSFSR. What do you want to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001367_DESC;The results of the referundum are clear, the Tartar people voted yes for their independence. A great victory for this people proud to be free from the Russian presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001368_DESC;The results of the referundum are clear, the Tartar people voted no for their independence. While some believe that there was fraud, most people trust the referendum result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001371_DESC;The idea of creating the post of President as a single head of state, at the link of a collegiate leadership, was first considered during the preparation of the Constitution of 1936 but was rejected by Stalin. After his death, there were attempts to create the post of President at the time of Khrushchev and Brezhnev, but never succeeded in maintaining the collegial leadership. With the coming to power of Gorbachev, the post of President of the USSR was created on March 15, 1990 and was elected by the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR. However, this was an exceptional measure and now the President should be elected by the people by direct and secret ballot. Gorbachev, having become too unpopular, will not stand for a second term and has the possibility of giving instructions as to whom he will support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001372_DESC;Viktor Alksnis is the leader of the pro-Union faction and has become famous as a stubborn opponent of perestroika and as a promoter of the Chinese model of economic reform. Now that he has come to power, he promised that he would abandon the Perestroika reforms, but would pursue economic reforms to move closer to the Chinese model. Moreover, Alksnis does not mince his words against the United States and will not hesitate to take the risk of military confrontation against them. He also considers the Eastern European countries as a kind of shield for the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001373_DESC;Oleg Shenin is a conservative Communist Party figure who began to emerge in the early 1990s, best known for his participation in the August Coup. However, in 2001, Shenin founded his own party to promote communism as it was applied in the 1980s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001374_DESC;Maxim Suraykin is a young communist who distinguishes himself from some party cadres by being openly anti-revisionist and an admirer of Stalin. Moreover, he puts forward his struggle that the party does not become too bourgeois.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001375_DESC;Aleksandr Vlasov could be President of the RSFSR with 48 more votes against Boris Yetsin (in reality, he lost the same election against 68 votes) and he is considered, since then, as Gorbachev's successor, but unlike Gorbachev, Vlasov has much more consensus within the party and is especially more pragmatic on a number of political and economic issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001376_DESC;Viktor Tyulkin is a member who became known within the party from 1989 for his anti-Gorbachev positions but advocating moderate reforms in order to preserve and advance the Soviet state, all based on Lenin's teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001377_DESC;The internal political situation in our country is no longer so stable and risks exploding. So the party has decided to take the situation in hand by putting in power a trustworthy person, experienced enough and really believing in the idea of socialism. The new head of the government is a certain Vladmir Putin, former Chairman of the KGB.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001378_DESC;After a period of uncertainty about a clear leader within the party and the country, one person managed to gain enough consensus to become the official leader of the Soviet Union. Having become President of the KGB during the troubled post-August period, Vladmir Putin is now the absolute master of the Kremlin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001379_DESC;Gennady Zyuganov became known in 1991 with the publication of the article "Architect amidst the Ruins", an open letter published in the neo-Stalinist newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya. It denounced Alexander Yakovlev, the chief ideologist of perestroika, and a prominent associate of Gorbachev. However, with time, Zyuganov began to take more and more reformist positions, not hesitating to collaborate with liberal forces. Now that he is in power, Zyuganov will probably try to incorporate his theories into the party ideology, introduce more pluralism while strictly controlling the media and liberalizing the country's economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001384_DESC;With the signing of the New Union Treaty, we are faced with a choice: do we want to transform the country into a Confederation, and thus give them more power, or do we want to recognize, in fact, more culture in order to maintain our new country politically?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001385_DESC;Eastern Europe is a very important issue, due to the fact that, geographically, the region is like a gateway to reach us. So, even if we have managed to democratize, we have to decide whether we should still consider this region as central by maintaining some kind of presence or just leave this region to concentrate elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001386_DESC;Now that we have sufficiently liberalized our country's economy, we have the opportunity to seek trade access with China. This would allow us to boost our economy and have access to goods more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001387_DESC;With the recent events in Soviet Russia, the country's economy has been liberalized and now their government is demanding access to our economy. Since we are close enough economically speaking, it should be advantageous for us because we will export our goods to a foreign country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001388_DESC;Surprisingly enough, our attempt at commercial rapprochement with China did not work out as we would have liked. Our relations with China are at an all-time low.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001389_DESC;Despite the fact that we have liberalized our economy, we have not really opened up to the Western world so that they can invest in our country. Faced with this, some members of the party have proposed to open, as in China, Special Economic Zones, in which the economic laws are more advantageous for companies than those practiced in the rest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001390_DESC;The relations between religions and the Soviet state have never been friendly, especially during Stalin. However, as the current government is more open, we have the opportunity to change our religious policy in our country. Some of the more conservative members would like us to continue, at least in the public agencies, to promote Atheism, other more moderate members would like us to stop State Atheism and apply Secularism, and finally others, much more reformist, would like us to use contact with the Russian Orthodox Church so that we can promote the values of this religion and thus get a little closer to the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001391_DESC;With the arrival in power of communists in West Germany, it is certainly possible to propose a unification of our two countries. Of course, this means that the new government will have to adopt communism and remain loyal to the Soviet Union. This should not be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001392_DESC;East Germany has made the proposal to finally unite our two countries separated since the end of World War II. Of course, this assumes that the new government is communist and remains loyal to the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001395_DESC;Since the Soviet state has become a social democracy, we have had to concede on many things that remind of the Soviet Union. Today, there is a debate about whether to change our national anthem.Conservative members of the party would, of course, like to keep the current anthem, other more moderate members would like to change some of the lyrics of the current anthem to make it more neutral, and some of the more left-wing members would like to bring back the International, our original anthem. However, some members would like the song "Long Live Our State" to become our new anthem. In addition to being popular with the population, it is a song that was proposed in 1943 when the anthem was changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001396_DESC;With the coming to power of Gorbachev and the implementation of more liberal policies, such as Perestroika, the Brezhnev Doctrine is seen by the Soviet government as oppressive policy. Moreover, the Soviet Union no longer had the means to impose its will on the countries of Eastern Europe. In the face of this, we have the opportunity to implement a policy that would allow the Warsaw Pact countries to determine their own internal affairs. This policy already has a name: the Sinatra Doctrine, after the song "My Way" popularized by Frank Sinatra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001397_DESC;Very soon, a new government will be put in place, which means that there will be new Ministers. Among them, one position is of particular interest, that of Minister of Foreign Affairs.Indeed, the person who occupied this position is leaving for retirement soon, and depending on who will be this new minister, a new doctrine can be adopted and candidates have been selected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001398_DESC;The candidates for the posts of Ministers of Foreign Affairs are the following: Semyon Kozyrev, participant in the Potsdam Confederation, former ambassador to several countries and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1966 and 1983, he is a very experienced member and adept at the policy implemented by Andrei Gromyko, which consists of Containment of the USA.Alexander Bessmertnykh, a moderate reformist, is a strong supporter of the rapprochement of the communist parties in Europe, he is a follower of the Pacific Coexistence. And Eduard Shevardnadze, a relatively young party member and part of the reformist faction that promotes the New Thinking Policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001399_DESC;Now that Semyon Kozyrev has become the new Foreign Minister, it means that the Brezhnev Doctrine will be maintained. However, some members of the cabinet would like to modernize this doctrine, to make it a little more acceptable. A solution is already found, it would be enough to impose economic sanctions on the dissident countries, which would still allow to control this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001400_DESC;Now that we have a new Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is now to change the Doctrine for the Warsaw Pact. Some would like to give more freedom of interpretation on Marxism, arguing that the Soviet Union does not have the monopoly of the right reading of Marx's works. Others would like to make the members of the Warsaw Pact equal, but this would make us lose influence in the region. And finally, others would like us to withdraw our military bases in these countries, in order to ease the situation in Europe and with the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001401_DESC;Since a certain relaxation in the promotion of Marxism-Leninism within the Warsaw Pact, more and more members in the party would officially like to have their own vision of Marxism promoted in the country. While many would like to put forward some of our characteristics, much like in China or even Romania, others would like to use this opportunity to strengthen the ideology of Marxism-Leninism in the party and in our society. Others, finally, warning of the risk that this could take and recalling the different tragedies of our block.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001402_DESC;Today we learn with surprise that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has just proclaimed a new interpretation of Marxism, which makes it a new ideology. We will have to react to this. Some members do not see any problem with this new interpretation, others, even if they are not hostile to this new ideology, keep a certain distrust, and finally others, are completely opposed to it and would like to cut all links with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001463_DESC;$CAPITAL$'s reconstruction projects already existed at the time of the Russian Empire, based on the examples of reconstruction of European cities such as Berlin or Rome. These first attempts were stopped because of the WWI, the 1917 revolutions and the Civil War. However, from 1920 onwards, the Soviet government began to think about rebuilding the city as the capital of the first socialist state in the world. During this period, some projects were born, but it was more a period of intensive discussions between "urbanists" and "ruralists". It was not until 1933 that these quarrels were stopped and a workshop was set up to study the issue, and 1935 that Stalin and Molotov approved the resolution "On the general plan of reconstruction of the city of $CAPITAL$". Although the plan was only partially implemented due to the resources, Stalin's ambitions and the WWII, the city had already started to change. With the death of Stalin and the rise to power of a new leadership, it is possible to resume the reconstruction of the city normally or to cancel it, claiming that the project was too elaborate and costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001464_DESC;Despite the cancellation of the $CAPITAL$ reconstruction project and of such important monuments as the Palace of Soviets, the need for a building for the meetings of the Supreme Soviet and for the CPSU Congresses became more and more important. Soon, the project will be made public and even the $MONARCHTITLE$ is personally involved in the project to put this building directly in the Kremlin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001465_DESC;Despite the cancellation of the $CAPITAL$ reconstruction project, the construction site of the Palace of Soviets remains empty. This project had begun in February 1931 with the demolition of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the beginning of the work had begun in 1939 with the implementation of the Foundation Piles. However, with the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the construction was interrupted, and worse, the steel structure was cut and used for the defense of the city and other purposes during the war. Since we have disavowed the Palace of the Soviets, we now have the choice of either rebuilding the Cathedral or turning it into an open-air pool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001466_DESC;By becoming a social democracy, more and more opinions and people, once suppressed or banned, are becoming more and more vocal. Since 1988, a public movement supported by the Orthodox Church wants to return the Cathedral of Christ the Savior to $CAPITAL$. We can allow it to be rebuilt, but that means we must remove the pool or, of course, keep the pool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001467_DESC;Since we decided to continue the project of reconstruction of the city of $CAPITAL$, one of the most emblematic monuments is the Palace of Soviets. This project started in February 1931 with the demolition of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the work began in 1939 with the laying of foundation piles. However, with the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, construction was interrupted, and worse, the steel structure was cut up and used for the defense of the city and other purposes during the war. However, some people would like to do something less expensive, such as an open-air swimming pool or even rebuild the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001468_DESC;The Stalinka was the name given to the building built under Stalin between 1930 and 1950. These apartments are of very good quality and very spacious, easily recognizable and generally did not rise more than 3 or 4 floors. This type of apartment requires a lot of time to work, because of, among other things, the detailed decoration style. Faced with the housing problem, the party members would like to at least keep this model but with less details, or even abandon this kind of apartment to create stantardized buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001469_DESC;In the project of reconstruction of the city, it was also planned to extend, to remake, entire streets inspired by European cities, like in Paris, but also to enlarge the Red Square. But this meant destroying buildings, historical monuments and monasteries. If we agree, we will have enough space to build a new building that was planned under Stalin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001470_DESC;With the permission to extend the streets of $CAPITAL$, we will be able to build one of the following buildings: The Palace of Technology, announced in 1933, was supposed to be located on the banks of the Moskva River. The building should have united all the scientists and technicians of $CAPITAL$ and was supposed to represent the Soviet industrial, technological, agricultural, transportation and communication achievements. The People's Defense Commissariat, announced in 1933, was supposed to be located on the Arbat Square and was to represent the power of the Red Army. The House of Books, announced in 1934 and supposed to be located on Pushkin Square in order to regroup all the publishing houses of the Union. And the Aeroflot Building, planned to be located at the Belorussky station, in homage to the aviator of the Great Patriotic War but above all to the rescuer of the Cheliuskin ship, which had sunk in the Arctic waters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001471_DESC;The Great Patriotic War caused a lot of losses, both military and civil, and in 1942 it was planned to build a monument to the defenders of $CAPITAL$ and it was suggested to erect it on the Red Square. Perhaps we can build this monument, but this time in the name of all victims of this war against fascism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001472_DESC;Although this led to internal debates at first, the decision to keep Lenin's body was made by the government in the year of his death in 1924. Although initially made of wood, the Mausoleum was finally built of red brick in 1929. As we continue the reconstruction of the city, we have the possibility, of course, to keep the building, or to build a bigger mausoleum, or even to build the project of Pantheon for all the dead of the important political personalities of the country. Although it was announced at the time of Stalin's death, it never materialized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001473_DESC;We are finally nearing the end of the reconstruction of $CAPITAL$ and it remains to settle the details. However, facing the amount of money we have spent, some members argue that it would be better to build a kind of wall around the city and to limit its access to outsiders as well, and that the inhabitants of the city cannot leave the city without a good reason. The city would undergo very little change, if not for the needs of the city. Should we accept this proposal that may cause controversy in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001474_DESC;The city was finally rebuilt, in the image that the government and the party wanted. It is possible, in view of this achievement, to decide to rename the city. Some, especially Stalinists, would like to give it Stalinodar, in order to pay tribute to Stalin. Although this name had been considered for a while, Stalin refused it, fearing that it would be some kind of joke on the part of his former adversaries (since he had noticed that most of the requests to change the name of the city came from former enemies). Others wanted to keep the name, of course, but another party wanted to rename it Sovietgrad, because the capital would represent the whole Soviet Union in the country and in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001406_DESC;Vladimir Zhirinovsky will begin to be known politically when Gorbachev, in 1990, removes the monopoly of power from the CPSU and allow other parties to be created and exist. Zhirinovsky created the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union, but he was soon suspected that the party was created with the KGB in order to serve the interests of the Soviet state. In the 1991 elections for the position of President of the RSFSR, he reached the 3rd position with 7.81% of the votes. During the August Coup, Zhirinovsky supported the Emergency Committee in public by insulting the democratic supporters, who lynched him. Zhirinovsky will be especially known in the world for his extreme and provocative positions, in particular his will to take back Alaska, to exterminate all the birds entering the Russian territory so that they can't transmit virus and etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001407_DESC;Grigori Yavlinsky did not join the CPSU until 1984-1985, when he was admitted to the leadership of the Ministry of Labor and then the Council of Ministers. However, Yavlinsky began to make a political name for himself when he joined a committee with Leonid Abalkin on how to economically reform the Soviet Union. Grigori Yavlinsky was soon in favor of the rapid transition from a planned to a market economy. He will present his project called "500 Days Program" (originally named "Transition to the Market") under the leadership of Stanislav Shatalin. His project will get the support of Boris Yestlin, Gorbachev will be septic and Nikolai Ryzhkov, Prime Minister of the USSR, will openly repudiate him, threatening to resign if the project were to pass. In reality, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and the implementation of the "shock therapy" by Yestlin, based on Yavlinsky's plans, he will be considered by his opponents and by some economists, as an example of what not to do in an economic transition or even accused of economic illiteracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001408_DESC;Alexander Lebed became known as the commander of the 106th Airborne Division and participated in the repression of interethnic uprisings, especially in the Caucasus, which usually ended brutally. During the August Coup, Lebed played an ambiguous but important role. Although he participated in the events, he eventually sided with the democrats, which allowed him to remain in the army and to be popular among the democrats. He left shortly afterwards to found his own party (first the Congress of Russian Communities and then the People's Republican Party of Russia) and soon became popular among the army and the Russian-speaking population, which some Western and Russian observers compared him to Pinochet and even Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001409_DESC;Aman Tuleyev started to be really interested in politics only from 1990 when he tried to become President of the RSFSR but will remain popular only in his fief, in Kemerovo. In 1991, he will openly support the August Coup and will start to take more importance later. Tuleyev became known for his hard-line stance on domestic policy but advocated a more flexible, even liberal, economic policy. Later, he would become known as a "Muslim communist" and would attract sympathy from some communist members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001456_DESC;Boris Yeltsin began to gain importance in politics when Gorbachev came to power with the recommendation of Egor Ligachyov, seeing him as a potential ally. Although he supported the Perestroika policy at the beginning, Yeltsin soon criticized Gorbachev as being too moderate. Yeltsin eventually became a rival to Gorbachev and the CPSU by becoming increasingly popular for his criticism of the party and by exacerbating the various nationalisms of the Soviet Union, even Russian nationalism. Even though the Soviet Union succeeded in reforming itself into a social democracy, Boris Yeltsin is considered by the communists to be a dangerous person and a potential destroyer of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001457_DESC;Alexander Yakovlev will play a big role in Gorbachev's reforms. Indeed, he was Gorbachev's main advisor and helped shape foreign policy by advocating a non-interventionist policy and helping to implement the Perestroika and Glasnost reforms, so much so that he was nicknamed the "godfather of Glasnost" and was the first Soviet politician to recognize the secret protocol of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. However, his primary objective was never, unlike Gorbachev, to try to save the Soviet Union but to destroy the Soviet Union. This will be learned years later, being loved by the liberals, but hated by the communists but also by the Russian nationalists for his anti-nationalist positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001458_DESC;Dmitri Vasilyev began to get involved in politics when he joined a historian's association, Pamyat, which became a monarchist, anti-Semitic and ultranationalist nationalist-orthodox organization the following year, advocating the restoration of the Russian Empire and the Romanovs. Now that he has come to power legally, nothing can stop him from realizing his dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001410_DESC;Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States has continued to implement a blockade against Cuba, even though it refuses to recognize this term. Since then, the Soviet Union and Cuba have remained allies, although there have been ups and downs. However, in recent times, some members have begun to question this economic support for Cuba. But, according to some influential members in the Politubro, they think that there may be a "poker move" to play against the United States by voluntarily provoking a diplomatic crisis. Cuba would have to agree to this first, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001411_DESC;An offer has been proposed to us by the Soviet Union, in fact, they claim that in order to "unblock the unjust economic situation" that the United States makes us suffer since the Cuban Missile Crisis. They propose us to put back missiles on our island in order to provoke a diplomatic crisis against them. Needless to say, many members of the party find this proposal dangerous, but others, who are in the minority, are tempted by the proposal, especially if it would stop the blockade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001413_DESC;We have just learned that the offer we made to put missiles on Cuba was refused. This was quite expected but we are still disappointed by this refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001414_DESC;Even if we had already observed strange activities on the island of Cuba, we have just learned via satellite images what we thought impossible. The Soviet Union is still trying to put missiles on Cuba! The entire country's General Staff is on alert and even though we have not yet told the public the truth, the population suspects that something is going on when they see the intensive military activities. Several solutions are being considered. The first one is to block Cuba completely, others propose the invasion of the island, even if it means provoking a nuclear war, some, more moderate, propose that we use the red phone to find a solution as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001415_DESC;Our missiles on Cuba were discovered by the Americans via their satellites. However, in response to this, the Americans decided to block Cuba completely, which could lead to the downfall of the Cuban regime in the longer term. Perhaps it is high time to start negotiations between our two nations, although some extremists propose that it is better to attack American ships, considering their actions as sufficient justification to declare war on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001416_DESC;Our missiles on Cuba were discovered by the Americans via their satellites. However, in response to this, the Americans decided to launch an invasion on Cuba. The situation is critical and many people propose nothing less than to launch nuclear missiles. However, some people ask that we call the USA via the red phone before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001417_DESC;Our two nations have managed to make contact and negotiations have begun in order to resolve this situation and avoid a potential nuclear war. Most of the diplomats and even the Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed that we should ask for a definitive end to the blockade on Cuba or else we could ask for the recovery of the western part of Berlin on behalf of East Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001418_DESC;In order to avoid a war between our two blocks, the Soviet Union proposed to stop the "Blockade" against Cuba. They argue that this policy towards Cuba is inhumane and a disgrace to the "land of freedom". This will be considered an important victory for the Communist Bloc if we accept, but if we refuse, it will mean war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001419_DESC;The Americans have agreed to lift the blockade against Cuba, in exchange, we agree to remove our missiles from the island as soon as possible. This is a great victory for the communist movement and in the anti-imperialist struggle. Although the means almost dragged the world once again into a nuclear winter, the people of Cuba and the Soviet Union sing the praises of our country and our leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001420_DESC;The Americans have agreed to lift the blockade against Cuba, in exchange, the Soviet Union has agreed to withdraw their missiles from our island as soon as possible. This is a great victory for the communist movement and in the anti-imperialist struggle. Although the means almost dragged the world into a nuclear winter once again, we have freed ourselves from the grip of the American tyrant, all thanks to communism and the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001421_DESC;Since Grigory Yavlinsky came to power, it is now possible for him to implement the "500-day program". The program contained an economic doctrine which, according to its authors, consists in passing from a planned economy to a market economy and openly capitalist, in less than 2 years. The project met many opponents, naturally, from the communists, but also from economists who considered that such a transition could not be done so quickly, especially in a population in which, in a good majority, did not know the principle of labor contract, did not really have concrete knowledge of private property or even business. However, if the project is to be carried out, the President says that it will be done in several clear steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001422_DESC;Since the 500-day program was launched, the daily life of the Soviet population has already been transformed, with the appearance of some things more and more paid. However, it is a matter of passing a new stage, the privatization of state property, which means both state-owned enterprises and land or housing that the population must buy. However, even within the government, members are arguing about how fast this privatization should be done. Some members would like a gradual privatization in order not to lose too much control and to make sure that the assets are in good hands and as fair as possible, while other members argue that the urgency of the situation requires that the privatization be done very quickly in order for the program to be successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001423_DESC;A new step has been taken in the 500 Days Program: the liberalization of prices. This means that the state no longer has control over price setting and that this is accompanied by a thorough reform of the Gosbank, the Central Bank of the Union. From now on, the Gosbank will have to play a commercial role as can be observed in other banks in Western countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001424_DESC;Today, in order to continue the 500 Days Program, a new step will be taken with the signing of a future treaty between the different republics, and future countries, of the Union. Indeed, in order to give a greater freedom, the government plans a massive decentralization of the institutions of the Union. Based in part on Western Europe, Grigori Yavlinsky wishes to give a quasi independence to the different republics of the Union, transforming them into quasi-countries. However, it remains to be seen to what extent his countries will have their independence. Will they be allowed economic freedom or will they be given other rights such as the possibility of having their own army, their own laws... In short, a greater political freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001425_DESC;Today, the government has just announced the end of the 500 Days Program, this was accompanied by the last reforms aimed at properly regulating the Soviet economic market without, theoretically, the state having to intervene. Only time will tell if these reforms will be sufficient to improve the economic situation of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001426_DESC;Since the implementation of the 500 Days Program and because of bad decisions or bad execution of the reforms, the population and even the different governors of the country, both in the RSFSR and in other countries, show discontent and demand new reforms. Indeed, while local governors complain that Moscow still has too much of a presence, the population, especially the communists, complain that the management of the country's resources is in the hands of oligarchs and that inequalities are increasing. We will have to decide what to do, maintain the status quo or give more freedom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001427_DESC;With the coming to power of Zhirinovsky, he had promoted during his campaign the Russian nationalism and had repudiated the other nationalists. Now that he is in power, Zhirinovsky has the opportunity to actively promote Russian culture throughout the Union. This will, of course, trigger a strong reaction among the general population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001459_DESC;During his presidential campaign, Vladimir Zhirinovsky promised to bring Alaska back under our banner. Now Zhirinovsky is about to send a message to the American President asking for the purchase of Alaska for a large sum of money. Needless to say, if we do this, the US is unlikely to agree to this request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001460_DESC;Today, we have just received a request, more than surprising, since the Russians have asked to buy back the lands of Alaska, arguing that it is a legitimate land of their country and that it is their right to take back these lands. What do we do...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001461_DESC;One of the proposals advocated by Vladimir Zhirinovsky was to take over the territories formerly held by Russia. Among these territories were the territories that the Russian Empire had settled in the north of present-day Iran, with the aim of creating a kind of security zone for the country. Today, Zhirinovsky will certainly send a request to Iran, do we want to claim "just" the north of the country or do we want to ask for the submission of the country under our domination?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001462_DESC;Today, we have just received an unusual request from the Russians. Indeed, they ask us that we "return" them all the north of the country so that it can with a kind of security zone between us and them. If we refuse this offer, it will certainly mean war between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001428_DESC;Since Vladimir Zhirinovsky came to power, he started to want more and more power for the position of President. This has obviously caused more and more conflicts between the supporters of the President and the communists and democratic parliamentarians of the Congress of People's Deputies. In the face of all this unrest, we still have a chance to avoid a major political crisis. Should we make some concessions to the communists?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001429_DESC;During the week, President Zhirinovsky once again appeared before the Congress of People's Deputies to request an extension of his powers, which was denied. Zhirinovsky left the hall insulting the parliamentarians as "parasites of the nation". Since then, violent demonstrations have taken place in the capital and even elsewhere in the country. Faced with his internal problems, the President declared a State of Emergency in the whole country. This was the last straw for the parliamentarians and the Congress of People's Deputies rejected the President's edit and voted by a majority to dismiss the President and an interim President was elected instead. This was Alexander Rutskoy, a person considered sufficiently trustworthy by the parliamentarians and, of course, a communist. Communist and pro-parliamentary supporters, as well as liberals, gathered at the House of Soviets and began to raise barricades as a show of force. Should we leave or should we confront?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001430_DESC;Since the government has decided to go into business, we will have to find allies. The first group that could support us are the Soviet nationalists, but we will have to promise them to restore a regime, at least similar to the one that existed before Gorbachev's reforms. The second group are the Russian nationalists, in exchange for which, we will have to set up a more personal regime and praise the Russian or even Slavic cultureAnd the last one is the Monarchists, in exchange for which the Romanov family will have to be restored to the throne of the Russian Empire. With whom do we want to form an alliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001431_DESC;Tensions are rising and more and more people are gathering around the House of Soviets. According to our latest information, the KGB allied with them and gave military equipment to the opponents and offered their services to counteract us. In order to restore order, the President has ordered law enforcement and our allies to attack the building.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001432_DESC;Despite the violent clashes between our supporters and the opponents, the latter managed to counteract us. The opponents are already claiming victory and are waiting for the next orders from the Parliamentarians and their President to decide what to do. Our forces are still too weak to counter them and we cannot wait for what they will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001433_DESC;The opposition forces have failed to stop and the House of Soviets is being bombed, it is only a matter of time before the parliamentarians give up. The fighting was hard, we almost entered the civil war, but now, although the world was shocked by our actions, the situation has been stabilized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001434_DESC;Their President, supported by communist and democrat parliamentarians, has just announced to his supporters the seizure of the Kremlin and to make our government definitively fold. The opposition is getting into their vehicle, armed by the KGB and by shields taken by our law enforcement agencies. On the way, citizens cheered them with red flags in the windows. Our security forces and supporters quickly organized themselves at strategic points to prevent them from attacking the President's residence. The clash of the two sides is even more violent and, for the moment, neither side has the advantage. Some supporters have proposed that the President go into exile rather than submit to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001435_DESC;Their President, supported by communist and democrat parliamentarians, has just announced to his supporters a counter-intuitive decision: to stay put. If many people do not understand the decision, it is to put pressure on the government in order to gain time. Newspapers from all over the world are commenting on the situation in our country. Worse, the population is starting to have more and more sympathy towards them and are giving the opposition all they can to maintain their morals. We don't have much of a choice anymore, either we try to establish contact with them or, as some supporters propose, the President goes into exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001436_DESC;In the midst of all this chaos, a helicopter flew across Moscow and a few minutes later it was announced on the radio that the hostilities were over. The population has just learned that President Zhirinovsky has gone into exile to Finland. The opposition has won a great victory, the event is already compared to October 1917, when the communist forces, with the help of Trotsky and the Kronstadt sailors managed to overthrow the liberal power of that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001437_DESC;While the last resistances of the pro-President supporters surrender. A crowd of people entered the Kremlin and the President's residence to arrest him. However, when they enter the door, they find only the lifeless body of Zhirinovsky, with a pistiolet in his hand. The news is announced on the radio and the situation calms down. The opposition won a great victory, the event is already compared to October 1917, when the Communist forces, with the help of Trotsky and the Kronstadt sailors, managed to overthrow the then liberal power. But for supporters of the former president, Zhirinovsky is seen as a kind of martyr, another victim of communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001438_DESC;While the last resistances of the pro-President supporters surrender. A crowd of people entered the Kremlin and the President's residence to arrest him. Opponents arrived in the President's office and arrested Zhirinovsky, who was taken away and will certainly be tried for treason and "disturbance of the nation". The opposition won a great victory, the event is already compared to October 1917, when the Communist forces, with the help of Trotsky and the Kronstadt sailors, managed to overthrow the then liberal power. But the President continues, despite everything, to agitate his partisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001439_DESC;Despite the balance of power, our supporters succeeded in pushing back the pro-parliamentary forces. It is up to us to decide what to do from now on. Either we decide to take advantage of their weakened forces and counterattack, or we decide not to take the risk and call for the start of negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001440_DESC;While the last resistances of the pro-President supporters surrender. A crowd of people entered the Kremlin and the President's residence to arrest him. However, while trying to open the door, the opposition is greeted by bullets. The opposition returned fire and after several seconds, which seemed like minutes, President Zhirinovsky was shot. The news is announced on the radio and the situation calms down. The opposition won a great victory, the event is already compared to October 1917, when the Communist forces, with the help of Trotsky and the Kronstadt sailors, managed to overthrow the then liberal power. But for supporters of the former president, Zhirinovsky is seen as a kind of martyr, another victim of communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001441_DESC;The camps met a few days later in a neutral place to find a solution to the conflict. The opponents are in an advantageous position and their conditions are as follows: President Zhirinovsky and his government must resign and the parliament must take power permanently. It is either that or the continuation of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001442_DESC;With the victory of President Zhirinovsky, the powers will be extended and the opponents will soon be charged with treason and "disturbance of the nation".

EVT_9001445_DESC;With the victory of Lebed in the last elections, the latter, with the broad support of the army and part of the population, Lebed has the opportunity to take advantage of his popularity rating to start taking more and more control in the country. Either that, or to continue to respect the democratic process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001446_DESC;Now that the decision has been made, the first step in controlling the country will be to gain control of the various republics of the Union. For this, the idea would be to liquidate almost all local leaders and replace them with army officers loyal to Lebed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001447_DESC;Although tensions still existed between the different peoples, because of our actions, there was an explosion of separatist tensions. We must act quickly, before it is too late, or we use our armies to brutally repress them, but we will be frowned upon internationally. Or we use the KGB to eliminate the various nationalist leaders and repress the most radical of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001448_DESC;Since the end of communism and the establishment of a more democratic regime, public order is no longer as secure and delinquency, once a vestige of the past, has exploded and bandits are organizing throughout the country. These people are easily recognizable, with their Italian raspberry-colored jackets, their gold watches, their imported vehicles... The worst thing is that even the youth want to become like them. We have to act quickly and fortunately for us there was an important event in Moscow. Indeed, one of these "New Russians" had the mistake to attack a member of the Thieves in the Law, the Russian mafia born in Stalin's gulag. We can use this opportunity either to disguise ourselves and eliminate them radically, or to let the Thieves in the Law do their job... but helping them anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001449_DESC;Today, a minor event is taking place, but it is expected by a part of the local population of Mount Sayan. Indeed, a new sky track has been opened bearing the name of the leader. In order to go faster, Lebed was advised to go there by helicopter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001450_DESC;Once the inauguration was over, President Alexander Lebed took off in his helicopter but died in a crash due to a collision with a electric line. The cause of the accident was an inexperienced new pilot, a non-updated map and bad weather conditions. His death is experienced as a tragedy by a large part of the population but not by the oligarchs. Indeed, Alexander Lebed had promised upcoming measures to improve the daily life of Russians and to purge corruption. There is even a conspiracy theory that it was the oligarchs and Lebed's rivals who organized all this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001451_DESC;Although Alexender Lebed is continuing to liberalize the country's economy gradually. A government meeting is being held to determine whether the state should privatize economic sectors, considered essential by some, such as electricity, oil, etc. Does the state still maintain some control over these activities even though partial privatization may take place, or is this left to the oligarchs in the name of a "healthy economy"?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001453_DESC;More and more, the powers given to the different republics started to decrease. This is explained by the fact that Lebed's attention to transforming the republics into an authority means that the local leaders will become mere governors and that any national or even regional decisions can only be made if Moscow, especially Lebed, is willing. This is also accompanied by an intensive anti-corruption campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001454_DESC;Although Lebed always considered himself a nationalist, he never rejected the Soviet Union, especially its emblematic figure, Lenin. Thus, there always existed a certain form of Soviet nationalism in society, that is to say, the recognition of a form of national super-identity around the Soviet Union without rejecting the different nationalities en bloc. Thus, we have the choice to promote Soviet nationalism or to promote Russian nationalism and provoke discontent... especially among non-Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001455_DESC;President Alexander Lebed is in his 70s and the weight of power is beginning to be felt by the public. Thus, Lebed will soon announce his retirement, but will the President announce an election in order to respect the democratic process, or will he look for a successor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001475_DESC;Although Brezhnev's health was always a concern, he managed to govern well even though it was not always easy. However, last night, the Secretary General suffered a stroke with serious consequences. Doctors say that it has become impossible for him to govern normally. Worse, his health will worsen over time. Faced with this, some members suggest that another person be chosen for the position of Secretary General. The first person suggested was Dinmukhamed Kunaev, a loyal supporter and close friend of Brezhnev who had proved his effectiveness in his native Kazakhstan. The second is Yuri Andropov, who is a notorious reformist but who has the advantage of being fairly respected or feared within the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001476_DESC;While the Secretary General Dinmukhamed Kunaev continued to work on his desk, he noticed a report signed by the President of the KGB, Yuri Andropov. In this report, Andropov wrote that he had conducted a secret survey to study the state of the Soviet economy and that the results were not good. Indeed, he reports that our economy is beginning to be overtaken by other countries such as Germany or Japan, that we are running out of reserves and that we are "entering a period of stagnation". If we do not make reforms to save the Soviet Union, we risk a collapse. How will the Secretary General react to all this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001477_DESC;The CPSU was convened for a special session in which Andropov's report was read. Although many party members criticize and few accept it. The Secretary General made it clear that according to his report, reforms would have to be made, but reassured that he would not want to put back a market economy and remain in the line of Marxism-Leninism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001478_DESC;With the announcement of reforms in the country, Dinmukhamed Kunaev, having always been interested in science, received an offer from the Academy of Sciences to try to help him find scientific solutions to the problems faced by the country. For this, it will be necessary to transfer a sum of money to them so that he can provide him and the party with concrete answers. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001479_DESC;Today, the Academy of Sciences reported that in order to face our growing technological deficiencies, they have proposed the creation of Scientific Complexes all over the country in order to try to recover our backwardness and maybe even take the lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001480_DESC;Today, the Academy of Sciences reported that in the face of agricultural problems, one solution would be to repeat the Virgin Lands Campaign experiment. For Dinmukhamed Kunaev, this is excellent news because, in Khrushchev's time, Kunaev was an ardent supporter of this policy by opening millions of hectares of land in central Kazakhstan but was replaced in 1962 by Ismail Yusupov, a closer ally for Khrushchev. However, with the approval and supervision of the Academy of Sciences and if Kunaev so wishes, the Virgin Lands Campaign can be resumed, more organized and better supervised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001481_DESC;In an attempt to increase the welfare and access to food of the population, the Secretary General intends to make an agricultural reform. There are two possibilities, either we give more freedom to the farmers and create cooperatives, or we decide to base ourselves on the Hungarian model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001482_DESC;As it was done in Kazakhstan, Dinmukhamed Kunaev intends to develop the economic potential of the country as soon as possible. However, there is a debate on what kind of industrialization the five-year plan should focus on. The most conservative would like to develop heavy industry in order to increase the economic potential of our country. Others would like to focus on the development of new technologies such as electronics. And finally, the moderates especially, want to focus on the welfare of the population by developing light industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001483_DESC;As a result of the rapid development of our heavy industry, we found ourselves with enough surplus to consider, with some members of the party, to export our oil and other natural resources to the countries of Eastern Europe, which would allow us to make a little extra profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001484_DESC;As a result of the rapid development of industry related to electronics, we found ourselves with enough surplus to consider, with some members of the party, exporting our goods to the countries of Eastern Europe, and even to China, which would allow us to make a little extra profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001485_DESC;With the rapid development of our economy and reforms led by Dinmukhamed Kunaev led to the demand by moderate party members to reforms also political. Faced with this, we can maintain our conservative positions, either we can satisfy only a part of these demands in order to meet them, or we decide to fully satisfy the moderates and implement political reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001486_DESC;Today, the General Secretary of the CPSU, Dinmukhamed Kunaev, died of a heart attack. His reign was only an extension of what Brezhnev could have done for the Soviet Union. Even though the economic potential of the country increased, the problems of the country were not dealt with seriously enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001487_DESC;Today, the General Secretary of the CPSU, Dinmukhamed Kunaev, died of a heart attack. With the implementation of the reforms necessary to try to save the Soviet Union, not only the economic potential has increased but the needs of the population have been largely met, which allows, for the moment at least, a stabilization of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001488_DESC;In order to fight against the corruption that was eating away at the Soviet Union, the General Secretary Yuri Andropov began to investigate party members on cases of corruption, embezzlement, some are even mediatized. In the end, this anti-corruption campaign is partly a kind of purge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001489_DESC;On the front page of the newspaper Kommunist, the theoretical journal of the CPSU, is published an article of the General Secretary displaying the ambitions of the leader, describing the objectives of his program and what he prepares for the future of the CPSU and the Soviet Union. For him, it is high time that the country begins to make reforms while keeping the "primordial" role of the party in this country and wishing to conduct reforms "without foreign methods". Although this reassures many party members, another part of the party remains skeptical. Only time will tell if all this will go well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001490_DESC;With the announcement of the beginnings of reforms in the country, our government opened a special commission to study, in a realistic way, how to reform the Soviet Union economically. Among the members of this commission, the First Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee, Mikhail Gorbachev, was very enthusiastic, perhaps even too much so, and Andropov himself had to calm down his ardor sometimes. Despite this, Yuri Andropov seemed to have enough confidence in Gorbachev to promote him within the party and even make him his protege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001491_DESC;When he was President of the KGB, Yuri Andropov led a very hard policy against dissidents, whoever they were. It is notably him who will use massively the repression via the psychiatric hospitals. Even when he is now General Secretary, Yuri Andropov continues to lead this same policy.  However, many reformists are asking to change and soften this policy or even to eliminate it. Do we accept their request?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001492_DESC;With the announcement of the reforms, it was obvious that the agricultural problem would eventually be addressed and the government is currently working on a new reform on agriculture. However, it remains to be seen which way we want to go: do we want to decentralize the Soviet economy by allowing the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives but with the close supervision of the KGB, or do we follow the Hungarian model by giving more freedom to the farmers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001493_DESC;In a few days, Andropov and his ministers will soon announce a historic reform for the country. The name of this reform is "Perestroika", meaning reconstruction. However, not everyone agrees on the meaning of this word. For Andropov and some of his supporters, the goal of Perestroika should allow a little more economic freedom for the population and progressively. For other reformists like Gorbachev, think that the reform should give much more freedom and much faster. Which side should we choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001494_DESC;Today, Andropov's prot√©g√©, Gorbachev, asked at a session of the commission for the reforms of the Soviet Union his willingness to implement a more transparent policy and give more freedom in the press by allowing publications, so far, banned. This created a small controversy within the party, especially among the converts and began to accuse Gorbachev of wanting to destroy the country. The General Secretary is the only one who can settle this situation by taking a decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001495_DESC;With the coming to power of Deng Xiaoping in China and Yuri Andropov in the Soviet Union, both reformists, relations between the two countries began to relax and rumors began to circulate that the two leaders would like to meet and perhaps even reconcile if all went well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001496_DESC;Since the announcement of Andropov's reforms, and especially with the influence of Gorbachev, the consciences of the population have begun to awaken and more and more people are questioning our power. Since a few days, students of Moscow University have started to organize a protest movement demanding, in addition to economic reforms, political reforms with the slogan "Perestroika WITH Demokratizatsiya". Worse, Baltic nationalist movements started to revolt for their independence and in other regions calls for general strikes started to spread. It is panic in the Kremlin and the CPSU. For Andropov, his nightmare is realistic and two camps are fighting to try to influence the General Secretary. The Conservatives and Moderates, under Viktor Grishin, leader of Moscow, asking for the sending of troops and the KGB to settle the situation. And the Reformists, under Mikhail Gorbachev, asking to respond to the population's demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001497_DESC;Although the whole world is shocked by the current events, the army has taken control of the situation and the KGB has suppressed any potential resistance movements. In the CPSU, most blame Gorbachev and his supporters for the current situation and accuse him of treason. Only Andropov can possibly save him, but this seems hard to believe. The other options seem to be to eliminate Gorbachev from public life but not to get too close to the conservatives, or to favor the conservatives and admit our mistakes to the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001498_DESC;Today, the General Secretary, Yuri Andropov, is dead. Despite the strong opposition in the party, Gorbachev managed to maintain himself as Andropov's protege and succeed him. This probably means the transformation of the Soviet Union into a social democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001499_DESC;After the dismissal of Gorbachev and the most radical reformists. Andropov, however, did not choose to get too close to the conservatives and a more moderate and respected person within the CPSU was chosen. Yevgeny Tyazhelnikov became the new General Secretary and intends to maintain the line of Andropov and the CPSU. Moreover, being a former Komsomol, Tyazhelnikov succeeded before the death of his predecessor in introducing moderates into the CPSU to ensure their loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001500_DESC;After the events with the student demonstrators. General Secretary Yuri Andropov not only politically eliminated Mikhail Gorbachev but also got closer to the conservatives. As a result, over time, Viktor Grishin became the figure of conservatism in the country, re-establishing the policy that Andropov had tried to establish during his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001501_DESC;Against all odds, predictions, and the experiences in the previous phases of the Civil War, the worst has started to be realized - military defeat at the hands of the radicalized partisan forces of the "Democratic Army of Greece". While our army continues to fight on, their ever-dwindling strongholds falling one by one, many more have started making preparations for the now inevitable fall of the government. \n\n Military and political advisers have already presented the government with a bold suggestion in the hope of preserving Greece and continuing our struggle: the revival of a plan abandoned during World War II to ask the British to allow us to base our government on the island of Cyprus. The plan failed at the time because of the reluctance of the colonial authorities to give up their power, as well as the fear that widespread support for Cyprus might mean the end of British colonial interests on the island. However, since that time, cracks have already formed in the British Empire and pressure for decolonization has grown worldwide. The Cypriot people will surely welcome this unfortunate Enosis with open arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001502_DESC;Although we have continued to abide by the Treaty of Kars, the situation in the region has evolved to the advantage of our side and it is now possible for us to put pressure on Turkey and press our claims. In order to have access to the Mediterranean Sea, we can just ask them to have a pass on their strait. However, some members of the party, either more radical or more ambitious, would like to ask for the city of Istanbul in order to give us a security guarantee on this strait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001503_DESC;With the victory of the communists in Greece, the local geo-political situation has changed... not to our advantage. That's why today, the Soviet Union is again putting pressure on us by asking for a free passage to the Mediterranean Sea. Even if we can refuse, it is better not to antagonize them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001504_DESC;With the victory of the communists in Greece, the local geo-political situation has changed... not to our advantage. That's why today, the Soviet Union is again putting pressure on us by asking for a free passage to the Mediterranean Sea. Even worse, they are asking for the transfer of our former capital, Istanbul. Even if we can refuse, it is better not to antagonize them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001505_DESC;Against all odds, Turkey refused to comply with our demands and preferred to turn to the United States. The defeat is total and it seems that we can't do much more with Turkey, however, some of the more radical members would like to launch an invasion on the country so that we can, definitely, secure our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001506_DESC;The independence of our country was possible thanks to the help of the Soviet Union. Although our people are celebrating this victory, it is now necessary to decide what we want to do next. Either we decide to join the Soviet Union, even though this may be very unpleasant for Iran. Or we ask to become a satellite state in exchange for territory. Or we declare our complete independence, including from the Soviet Union, but we are risking a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001507_DESC;As a result of our victory for the independence of Azerbaijan, especially thanks to our help, their government has asked us to join their country. This may cause a general international discontent, especially with Iran, but we can always propose a solution or even refuse their offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001508_DESC;As a result of our victory for the independence of Azerbaijan, especially thanks to our help, their government has just asked us to remain a satellite state but is asking for an exchange of territory. This may cause a general international discontent, especially with Iran, but we can always propose a solution or even refuse their offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001509_DESC;As a result of our victory for the independence of Azerbaijan, especially thanks to our help, their government has just announced their independence from the Soviet Union. This does not go in our direction and an invasion is already expected. It remains to be seen whether we want to make it a satellite state or integrate it directly... or whether we can accept the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001510_DESC;After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies had provided in the Treaty of Sevres the creation of a Kurdistan, but was never ratified and the reconquest of its regions by Kemal Atat¸rk allowed him a new treaty more just for the Turks: the Treaty of Lausanne. However, with the independence of our country with the help of the Soviets and with the patience of our diplomats with the countries around us, it may be possible for us to ask them to return our lands by renegotiating the Treaty of Lausanne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001511_DESC;After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies had provided in the Treaty of Sevres the creation of a Kurdistan, but was never ratified and the reconquest of its regions by Kemal Atat¸rk allowed him a new treaty more just for the Turks: the Treaty of Lausanne. However, the Republic of Mahabad, unofficially called Kurdistan, is demanding that the Treaty of Lausanne be renegotiated to give them back their land. What do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
