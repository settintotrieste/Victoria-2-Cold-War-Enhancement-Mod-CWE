campaigning_farmer_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Farmers;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_farmer_desc;A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_labourers_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Miners;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_labourers_desc;A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, or other mineral from the earth through mining. There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock. In a broader sense, a "miner" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face. Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world. In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_craftsmen_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Factory Workers;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_craftsmen_desc;The factory system is a method of manufacturing using machinery and division of labour. Because of the high capital cost of machinery and factory buildings, factories were typically privately owned by wealthy individuals who employed the operative labour. Use of machinery with the division of labour reduced the required skill level of workers and also increased the output per worker. Industrialisation has placed a great deal of power into the hands of factory workers such that many  nations cannot ignore their plight.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_business_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Businessmen;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_business_desc;A businessman or businesswoman is a person involved in the business sector – in particular someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating cash flow, sales, and revenue by utilising a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_middle_class_title;Campaign for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Middle Class;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_middle_class_desc;The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy. Its usage has often been vague whether defined in terms of occupation, income, education or social status. The definition by any author is often chosen for political connotations. Writers on the left favor the lower-status "working class". Modern social theorists—and especially economists—have defined and re-defined the term "middle class" in order to serve their particular social or political ends. Within capitalism, "middle-class" initially referred to the bourgeoisie, later, with the further differentiation of classes as capitalist societies developed, the term came to be synonymous with the term petite bourgeoisie.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_military_class_title;Campaign for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_military_class_desc;A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. It is typically officially authorized and maintained by a sovereign state, with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform. It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force, marines, or coast guard. The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_city_class_title;Campaign for Urban Interests;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_city_class_desc;By definition, cities consist of very large numbers of people living in a relatively small amount of space. Some of these people have a good deal of money, but many people, and in some cities most people, have very little money. Cities must provide many kinds of services for all their residents, and certain additional services for their poorer residents. These basic facts of city life make for common sets of problems affecting cities throughout the nation, albeit to varying degrees, with some cities less able than others to address these problems. We shall talk a lot about this during the campaign.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_rural_class_title;Campaign for Rural Interests;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_rural_class_desc;In general, a rural area or countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines the word rural as encompassing "...all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area. Whatever is not urban is considered rural". Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. Agricultural areas are commonly rural, as are other types of areas such as forests. Different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

campaigning_dictatorship_middle_title;Court the Middle Class;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_middle_desc;The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy. Its usage has often been vague whether defined in terms of occupation, income, education or social status. The definition by any author is often chosen for political connotations. Writers on the left favor the lower-status "working class".;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_poor_title;Court the Lower Class;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_poor_desc;The working class (or labouring class) comprises those engaged in waged or salaried labour, especially in manual-labour occupations and industrial work. Members of the working class rely exclusively upon earnings from wage labour, thus, according to more inclusive definitions, the category can include almost all of the working population of industrialised economies, as well as those employed in the urban areas (cities, towns, villages) of non-industrialised economies or in the rural workforce.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_reformists_title;Court the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Party Reformists;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_reformists_desc;There are certain sections in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government who advocate for political reform of our authoritarian system. We can choose to promote some of these reformists to more senior positions in the government in order to help with any liberalisation plans the $MONARCHTITLE$ may have.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_hardliners_title;Court the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Party Hardliners;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_hardliners_desc;There are certain sections in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government who advocate for the continued rule of our totalitarian system. Promoting more of these people to senior civil servants, generals and ministers will help insulate the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ parliament from the more reformist minded individuals who may threaten the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_primary_culture_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Racial Supremacy;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_primary_culture_desc;Supremacism is the belief that a certain group of people is superior to all others. Such a campaign will be extremely controversial and frowned upon by the international community.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

campaigning_national_religion_title;Campaign for the National Religion;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_national_religion_desc;We shall focus on the national religion of $COUNTRY$ in the hopes of getting a divine wave of support from the people. The international community of secular states will not be pleased with our aims of creating a de-secularised state.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_secularism_title;Campaign for Secularism;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_secularism_desc;Secularism may refer to any worldview or principle which defines the secular at a given context, and prioritises, justifies or promotes it over the non-secular. "Secularism" has a broad range of meaning. While its definition as the separation of religion from civic affairs and the state is the most common, it may connote anticlericalism, atheism, naturalism, banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere and much more.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_independence_title;Campaign for the Independence of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_independence_desc;The right of a people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law, binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms. It states that people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between peoples should be—nor what constitutes a people. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

EVTNAME14000_sub;Trade Policy Debated in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_trade_policy_desc;International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories because there is a need or want of goods or services.

EVTDESC7000099;A group of senior party members have sent a letter to the $MONARCHTITLE$ to criticise his recent debate performance where he did not support the party's established issue position. Some of our party supporters have viewed this as a betrayal of their vote and there is growing concern as to whether we might lose our base in the coming election. The $MONARCHTITLE$ need not worry too much at this time though because the party whip will try to get the cabinent to mouth his line but the whip does warn of the possible consequences of failing to placate the party faithful.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
