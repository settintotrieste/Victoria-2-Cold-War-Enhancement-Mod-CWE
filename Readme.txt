### On the issue of in-game music ###

The mod file downloaded from this website does not contain any music other than the main menu theme. 

To get music to play mid-game, the CWE Music Addon Pack must be downloaded. This was done to avoid exceeding the Moddb upload size limit.

The music pack contains an assortment of 96 songs for a better Cold War immersion.

### How to install the CWE Music Addon Pack ###

Step 1: Download the Github zip file containing the music submod from the following Github page: https://github.com/settintotrieste/CWE-Music-Addon-Pack

Step 2: Extract out the 'CWE Music Addon' folder and CWE Music Addon.mod file in the zip file and move them into 'Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod'

Step 3: Check the options for 'Cold War Enhancement Mod...' and 'CWE Music Addon' in the Victoria 2 launcher then launch the game.

Enjoy!
